<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2></div>





<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is, perhaps, little need of detaining the kind

reader, even for one moment, in this the vestibule of our

Temple of Liberty, to state the motives and reasons for

the publication of this collection of Anti-slavery testimonies.</p>



<p>The good cause to which the volume is devoted;&mdash;the

influence which must ever be exerted by persons of

exalted character, and high mental endowments;&mdash;the

fact that society is slow to accept any cause that has not

the baptism of the acknowledged noble and good;&mdash;the

happiness arising from making any exertion to ameliorate

the condition of the injured race amongst us, will, at

once, suggest reasons and motives for sending forth this

offering, which, while it shall prove acceptable as a <span class="smcap">Gift

Book</span>, may help to swell the tide of that sentiment that,

by the Divine blessing, will sweep away from this otherwise

happy land, the great sin of <small>SLAVERY</small>.</p>



<p>Should this publication be instrumental in casting <i>one</i>

ray of hope on the heart of one poor slave, or should it

draw the attention of one person, hitherto uninterested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>

to the deep wrongs of the bondman, or cause one sincere

and earnest effort to promote emancipation, we believe

that the kind contributors, who have generously responded

to our call, not less than the members of our Society,

will feel themselves gratified and compensated.</p>



<p>The proceeds of the sale of the &#8220;<span class="smcap">Autographs for

Freedom</span>,&#8221; will be devoted to the dissemination of

light and truth on the subject of slavery throughout the

country.</p>

Society</i>,&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tiny" />





<h2 class="nobreak">BE UP AND DOING.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">Can</span> nothing be done for Freedom? Yes,

much can be done. Everything can be done.

Slavery can be confined within its present bounds.

It can be meliorated. It can be, and it must be

abolished. The task is as simple as its performance

would be beneficent and as its rewards

would be glorious. It requires only that we follow

this plain rule of conduct and course of

activity, namely, to do, everywhere, and on every

occasion what we can, and not to neglect nor

refuse to do what we can at any time, because at

that precise time and on that particular occasion

we cannot do more. Circumstances define possibilities.

When we have done our best to shape

them and to make them propitious, we may rest

satisfied that superior wisdom has, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>

controlled them and us, and that it will be satisfied

with us if we do all the good that shall then

be found possible.</p>



<p>But we can, and we must begin deeper and

lower than the composition and combination of

factions. Wherein do the security and strength

of slavery consist? You answer, in the constitution

of the United States, and in the constitutions and

laws of the slave-holding States. Not at all. It

is in the erroneous sentiments of the American

people. Constitutions and laws can no more rise

above the virtue of the people than the limpid

stream can climb above its native spring. Inculcate

the love of freedom and the sacredness of the

rights of man under the paternal roof. See to it,

that they are taught in the schools and in the

churches. Reform your own codes and expurgate

the vestiges of slavery. Reform your own

manners and customs and rise above the prejudices

of caste. Receive the fugitive who lays his

weary limbs at your door, and defend him as you

would your household gods, for he, not they, has

power to bring down blessings on your hearth.

Correct your error that slavery has any constitutional

guarantee that may not be released, and

that ought not to be relinquished. Say to slavery,

when it shows its bond and demands its pound of

flesh, that if it draws one drop of blood its life

shall pay the forfeit. Inculcate that the free

States can exercise the rights of hospitality and

humanity, that Congress knows no finality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

can debate, that Congress can at least mediate

with the slave-holding States, that at least future

generations may be bought and given up to freedom.

Do all this, and inculcate all this, in the

spirit of moderation and benevolence, and not of

retaliation and fanaticism, and you will ultimately

bring the parties of this country into a common

condemnation and even the slave-holding States

themselves into a renunciation of slavery, which is

not less necessary for them than for the common

security and welfare. Whenever the public mind

shall be prepared, and the public conscience shall

demand the abolition of slavery the way to do it

will open before us, and then mankind will be

surprised at the ease with which the greatest of

social and political evils can be removed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LETTER FROM THE EARL OF CARLISLE TO THE

SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p class="right"><span class="smcap">London, July 8, 1852.</span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>:&mdash;</p>



<p>I should be very sorry indeed to refuse any

request addressed to me from &#8220;the Rochester

Ladies&#8217; Anti-Slavery Association.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the same time I really should feel at a loss

what to send, but as I am on the point of sending

off a letter to the authoress of Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin,

I venture to submit a copy of it to those who I

feel sure must be fond of such a countrywoman.</p>



<p class="right"><span class="gapright2">Your very faithful Servant,</span></p>



<div class="figright"><img src="autographs_images/i_007.jpg" alt="" />



<p class="right">Carlisle</p></div>





<hr class="tb" />



<p class="right"><span class="smcap">London, July 8, 1852.</span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>:&mdash;</p>



<p>I have allowed some time to elapse before I

thanked you for the great honor and kindness you

did me in sending to me, from yourself, a copy of

Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin. I thought it due to the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>

of which I perceived that it treated, not to

send a mere acknowledgment, as I confess from

a motive of policy I am apt to do, upon the first

arrival of the book. I therefore determined to

read, before I wrote.</p>



<p>Having thus read, it is not in the stiff and conventional

form of compliment, still less in the

technical language of criticism, that I am about

to speak of your work. I return my deep and

solemn thanks to Almighty God, who has led

and enabled you to write such a book.</p>



<p>I do feel, indeed, the most thorough assurance

that in His good providence such a book cannot

have been written in vain. I have long felt that

slavery is by far the <i>topping</i> question of the world

and age we live in, involving all that is most

thrilling in heroism, and most touching in distress,&mdash;in

short, the real epic of the universe. The

self-interest of the parties most nearly concerned

on the one hand, the apathy and ignorance of

unconcerned observers on the other, have left these

august pretensions to drop very much out of sight,

and hence my rejoicing that a writer has appeared

who will be read, and must be felt, and that happen

what may to the transactions of slavery, they

will no longer be suppressed, &#8220;carent quia vate

sacr�.&#8221;</p>



<p>I trust that what I have just said was not

required to show the entire sympathy I entertain

with respect to the main truth and leading scope

of your high argument, but we live in a world only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>

too apt to regard the accessories and accidents of

a subject above its real and vital essence; no one

can know so well as you how much the external

appearance of the negro detracts from the romance

and sentimentality which undoubtedly might

attach to his position and his wrongs, and on this

account it does seem to me proportionately important

that you should have brought to your

portraiture great grace of style, great power of

language, a play of humor which relieves and

brightens even the dark depth of the back-ground

which you were called upon to reveal, a force of

pathos which, to give it the highest praise, does not

lay behind even all the dread reality, and, above all,

a variety, a discrimination, and a truth in the

delineation of character, which even to my own

scanty and limited experience of the society you

describe accredits itself instantaneously and irresistibly.

Seldom, indeed, could I more forcibly

apply the line of a very favorite poet,&mdash;</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;And truths divine came mended from that tongue.&#8221;</p>



<p>I have been told that in an English periodical,

the quality of genius has been denied to your

book. The motives which must have guided its

composition will probably have made you supremely

indifferent to mere criticism, especially to

any which argues so much obfuscation both of

head and heart. Your work has genius of the

highest order, and it is the lowest of its merits.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>There is one point which, in face of all that your

book has aimed at and achieved, I think of

extremely slight importance, but which I will

nevertheless just mention, if only to show that I

have not been bribed into this fervor of admiration.

I think, then, that whenever you speak of England

and her institutions, it is in a tone which fails to

do them fair justice. I do not know what distinct

charges you think could be established

against our aristocracy and capitalists, but you

generally convey the impression that the same

oppressions in degree, though not in kind, might

be brought home to them which are now laid to

the charge of Southern slave-holders. Exposed

to the same ordeal, they might very probably not

stand the test better. All I contend for is, that

the circumstances in which they are placed, and

the institutions by which they are surrounded,

make the parallel wholly inapplicable. I cannot

but suspect that your view has been in many

respects derived from composers of fiction and

others among ourselves who, writing with distinguished

ability, have been more successful in

delineating and dissecting the morbid features of

our modern society, than in detecting the principle

which is at fault, or suggesting the appropriate

remedy. My own belief is, liable, if you please,

to national bias, that our capitalists are very much

the same sort of persons as your own in the

Northern States, with the same mixtures and

inequalities of motive and action. With respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>

to our aristocracy, I should really be tempted to

say that, tried by their conduct on the question of

Free Trade, they do not sustain an unfavorable

comparison with your uppermost classes. Allow

me to add, that when in one place you refer to those

who have already emancipated their slaves, I think

a case more directly in point than the proceedings

of the Hungarian nobles might have been selected:

such, at least, I feel sure would have been the case,

if the passages in question had been written by

one who certainly was keenly alive to the faults

of England, but who did justice to her good qualities

and deeds with a heartiness exceeding that of

most of her own sons,&mdash;your great and good Dr.

Channing.</p>



<p>I need not repeat how irrelevant, after all, I feel

what I have said upon this head to be to the main

issues involved in your work; there is little doubt,

too, that as a nation we have our special failings,

and one of them probably is that we care too little

about what other nations think of them.</p>



<p>Nor can I wish my countrymen ever to forget

that their own past history should prevent them

from being forward in casting accusations on their

transatlantic brethren on the subject of slavery.

With great ignorance of its actual miseries and

horrors, there is also among us great ignorance of

the fearful perplexities and difficulties with which

its solution could not fail to be attended. I feel,

however, that there is a considerable difference

between reluctant acquiescence in what you inherit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>

from the past, and voluntary fresh enlargements

and reinforcements of the system. For

instance, I should not say that the mode in which

such an enactment as the Fugitive Slave Law has

been considered in this country has at all erred

upon the side of overmuch indignation.</p>



<p>I need not detain you longer: I began my

letter with returning thanks to Almighty God for

the appearance of your work, and I offer my

humble and ardent prayer to the same Supreme

Source that it may have a marked agency in hastening

the great consummation, which I should

feel it a practical atheism not to believe must be

among the unfulfilled purposes of the Divine

power and love.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MOMMA CHARLOTTE.</h2></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Slavery</span> is merely an idea!&#8221; said Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;;

&#8220;the slaves are, in reality, better off than we are, if

they had sense enough to know it. They are

taken care of&mdash;(they must be, you know, because

it is the master&#8217;s interest to keep them in good

condition, and a man will always do what is for

his interest). They get rid of all responsibility,&mdash;which

is what we are groaning under; and if they

were only let alone, they would be happy enough,&mdash;happier

than their masters, I dare say.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You think it, then, anything but kindness to

urge their emancipation?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To be sure I do! and I would have every one

that teaches them to be discontented hung up

without judge or jury.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You seem particularly interested for the

slave,&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Interested! I would have every one of them

sent beyond the Rocky Mountains, if I could,&mdash;or

into &#8216;kingdom come,&#8217; for that matter. They

are the curse of the country; but as long as they

are <i>property</i>, I would shoot any man that put bad

ideas in their heads or that interfered with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>

management of them, as I would shoot a dog that

killed my sheep.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But do they never get what you call &#8216;bad

ideas&#8217; from any but white people?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O, there is no knowing where they get them,&mdash;but

they are full of &#8217;em. No matter how kind

you are to them, they are never satisfied!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can tell you where they get some of their

ideas of slavery, if you will allow me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Certainly,&mdash;I am always glad of information.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;I will take up your time with nothing

but actual facts, for the truth of which I will be

answerable. In a Western tour, not many years

since, I saw one day a young lady, fair as a lily,

and with a sweet expression of countenance, walking

in the street with a little black girl whom she

held by the hand. The little girl was about six

years old, neatly dressed and very clean; and on

her neck she had a little gauze shawl that somebody

had given her, the border of which was composed

of the figure of the American Eagle many

times repeated, each impression accompanied by

the word &#8216;<span class="smcap">Liberty</span>,&#8217; woven into the fabric.</p>



<p>&#8220;This curious decoration, together with the

wistful look of the child&#8217;s face, and the benevolent

air of the young lady, with whom I was slightly

acquainted, led me to ask some questions, which

were answered with an air in which modesty and

sensibility were blended. I learned that the young

lady had undertaken the trying task of accompanying

the little girl through the place&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>

was a considerable village&mdash;for the purpose of

collecting the sum of fifty dollars, with which to

purchase the freedom of the child.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;And how,&#8217; said I, &#8216;did you become interested

in the poor little thing?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;She belongs to a member of my family,&#8217; said

Miss C&mdash;&mdash;, with a blush; &#8216;to my aunt, Mrs. Jones.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;And how did she find her way to the north?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Her mother, who is the servant of my aunt,

got leave to bring Violet along with her, when her

mistress came here for the summer.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;But both mother and child are free by the

mere circumstance of being brought here,&mdash;&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;O, but Momma Charlotte promised her mistress

that she would not leave her, nor let Violet

do so, if she might bring the child with her, and

beg money to buy her. She says she does not

care for freedom for herself.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I could not do less than go with the good girl

for awhile, to assist a little in her labor of love,

which in the end, and with a good deal of difficulty,

was finally accomplished. It was not until

after this that I became acquainted with Momma

Charlotte, the mother of Violet, and learned a few

of the particulars of a story which had made her

&#8216;not care for freedom.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Momma Charlotte was the mother of ten children,&mdash;six

daughters and four sons. Her husband

had been a free black,&mdash;a carpenter, able to keep

a comfortable home for his family, hiring his wife

of her master. At the time of the Southampton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

insurrection, this man was among the suspected,

and, on suspicion, not proof, he was taken up,&mdash;tried,

after the fashion of that time, and hung, with

several others,&mdash;all between sunset and sunrise of

a single day.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;He was innocent,&mdash;he had had no hand in

the matter, as God is my judge!&#8217; said poor Momma

Charlotte.</p>



<p>&#8220;This was but the beginning of troubles. A

sense of insecurity made the sale of slaves more

vigorous than ever. Charlotte&#8217;s children were sold,

one by one&mdash;no two together&mdash;the boys for the

sugar country,&mdash;the girls for&mdash;&#8216;the New Orleans

market,&#8217; whence they were dispersed, she never

knew where.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;All gone!&#8217; she said; &#8216;where I could never

see &#8217;em nor hear from &#8217;em. I don&#8217;t even know

where one of &#8217;em is!&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;And Violet?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;O yes,&mdash;I mean all but Violet. She&#8217;s all

I&#8217;ve got in the world, and I want to keep her. I

begged Missus to let me keep jist one! and she

said if I could get any body to buy her for me, I

might have her,&mdash;for you know I couldn&#8217;t own

her myself, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m a slave.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;But you are no longer a slave, Momma Charlotte;

your mistress by bringing you here voluntarily

has freed you,&mdash;&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&mdash;I know,&mdash;but I promised, you see!

And I don&#8217;t care to be free. I&#8217;m old, and my

children&#8217;s gone, and my heart&#8217;s broke. I ha&#8217;n&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

no more courage. If I can keep Violet, it&#8217;s all I

expect. My mistress is good enough to me,&mdash;I

live pretty easy.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Such was Momma Charlotte&#8217;s philosophy, but

her face told through what sufferings such philosophy

had been acquired. A fixed grief sat on her

brow; since the judicial murder of her husband

she had never been known to laugh,&mdash;hardly to

smile. Her eyes were habitually cast on the

ground, and her voice seemed always on the brink

of tears. She was what you call &#8216;<i>dissatisfied</i>,&#8217; I

think, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O, you have selected an extreme case! those

things very seldom happen.&#8221; (Seldom!) &#8220;After

all, you see the poor old thing knew what was

right; she showed the right spirit,&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;she,&mdash;but her <i>owners</i>?&#8221;</p>



<p>Here Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; was sure he saw a friend at a

distance to whom it was necessary he should

speak immediately; so he darted off, and I lost

the benefit of his defence of the peculiarities of the

peculiar institution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> compliance with the request that I would

send a few lines for insertion in &#8220;The Anti-Slavery

Autograph,&#8221; I may say that I cannot

express too strongly my conviction that, if there be

truth in Revelation, it is the duty of every Christian

to promote, by all legitimate means, not only the

universal and total, but the <i>immediate</i> abolition of

any system under which man can hold property in

his fellow man. Perhaps few of those who take

this view of the subject are sufficiently careful to

avoid, as far as possible, any participation in, or

encouragment of slavery, by refusing to use the

produce of the unrequited toil of the slave. Yet

until we do this, I think we have little right to

expect the Divine blessing upon our efforts to

promote the abolition of slavery and of the slave

trade.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SLAVERY AND POLYGAMY: DOCTORS OF

DIVINITY IN A DILEMMA.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">An</span> argument is derived from the Jewish Scriptures

in favor of slave-holding, very plausible and

weighty with that large class of persons so poorly

gifted with hearts as to find it difficult to discriminate

between the letter that killeth and the spirit

that maketh alive. The Old Testament shows

clearly enough, that slave-holding was tolerated

among the Jews; and it being assumed that the

system of Jewish society, or, at all events, that the

Mosaic code was framed after a Divine model, it

is alleged to be at least supererogatory, if not

actually impious, to denounce as inconsistent

with Christianity that which God permitted to his

chosen and selected people. Are <i>we</i> to pretend to

be better and wiser than Abraham and Moses,

David and Solomon?</p>



<p>A recent application of this same argument can

hardly fail to operate with many, as what the

mathematicians call a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>; a

proof, that is, of the falsity of a proposition assumed,

by exhibiting its operation in other cases.</p>



<p>The famous Mormon doctrine of the plurality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>

of wives, now at length openly avowed by the

heads and apostles of that new sect, is upheld and

justified by this very same argument. It plainly

appears from the Old Testament, that polygamy

equally with slavery, was one of the social institutions

of the Jews, recognized and sanctioned by

their laws. And borrowing the tone, and indeed

the very words of our pro-slavery theologians,&mdash;&#8220;Do

you pretend,&#8221; asks Orson Hyde, one of the

Mormon apostles, addressing himself to those who

question this new privilege of the saints&mdash;&#8220;Do

you pretend to set yourselves above the teaching

of God, and the example of his chosen people?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nor does the analogy between the two cases

stop here. According to the pro-slavery biblical

argument, slave-holding is only to be justified in

Christian slave-holders, who, in holding slaves,

have in view not only selfish benefit or advantage,

but the good of the slaves, (who are not able

to take care of themselves,) and the glory of God.

According to the Mormon biblical argument,

polygamy is to be allowed only to the saints; and

that, not for any sensual gratification, but only

for the benefit of the women, (who, according to

the Mormon doctrine, cannot get to heaven without

some holy husband to introduce them,) and

for the raising up of a righteous seed to God&#8217;s

glory.</p>



<p>Their favorite biblical argument, urged with

such a tone of triumph and self-satisfaction in all

the southern presbyteries and consociations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

in some northern ones, being thus newly applied

by the Mormons, our pro-slavery friends are placed

in a somewhat delicate dilemma. For they must

either abandon as invalid their dogma of slave-holding

derived from Jewish practices, or, if they

still hold on to the argument, and maintain its

force, they must prepare to extend the right hand

of fellowship to Brigham Young and his five and

forty wives. It is, indeed, very natural, in fact

inevitable, that slavery and polygamy, avowed or

disavowed, should go together; nor does any good

reason appear why those who find justification for

the one in the Jewish Scriptures should hesitate

about accepting the other.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SLAVE AND SLAVE-OWNER.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I would</span> rather be anything than a slave,&mdash;except

a slave-owner!&#8221; said a wise and good

man. The slave-owner inflicts wrongs,&mdash;the slave

but suffers it. He has friends and champions by

thousands. Some men live only to defend and

save him. Many are willing to fight for him.

Some even to die for him.</p>



<p>The most effective romance of our times has

been written for slaves. The genius of more than

one of our best poets has been consecrated to

them. They divide the hearts and councils of our

great nation. They are daily remembered in the

prayers of the faithful. They are the most earnest

topic of the christian world.</p>



<p>But the slave-owner! who weeps, who prays,

who lives, who dies for him! True, he is of the

boasted Saxon race, or descended from the brilliant

Gaul, or gifted Celt. He is enriched by the transmitted

civilization of all ages. He has been

nurtured by christian institutions. To him have

been opened the fountains of Divine truth. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

from this elevation he is to be dragged down by

the mill-stone of slavery.</p>



<p>If he be a rural landlord, he looks around upon

his ancestral possessions, and sees the curse of

slave-ownership upon them,&mdash;he knows the time

must come when &#8220;the field shall yield no meat,

the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there

shall be no herd in the stall.&#8221; To him the onward

tendencies of the age are reversed. His movement

is steadily backward.</p>



<p>To the slave are held out the rewards of fortitude,

of long suffering, of meekness, of patience in

tribulation. What and where are the promises

to the slave-owner?</p>



<p>Thousands among them are in a false position.

They are the involuntary maintainers of wrong,

and transmitters of evil. Hundreds among them

have scrupulous consciences and tender feelings.

They use power gently. They feed their servants

bountifully. They nurse the sick kindly,&mdash;and

devote weary days to their instruction. But alas!

they live under the laws of slave-owners. They

are forbidden to teach the slave to read, write, or

cipher, to give them the means of independent

progress and increasing light. Their teaching is

as bootless as the labor of Sysyphus! most wearisome

and disheartening.</p>



<p>The great eras of domestic life, bright to the

thoughtless slave, are dark with forecasting shadows

to the slave-owner. The mother cannot forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

her sorrows, because a man-child is born. If

she dare contemplate his future, she sees that the

activities of his nature must be repressed, his faculties

but half developed, his passions stimulated

by irresponsible power, inflamed by temptation,

and solicited by convenient opportunity. She

knows that his path in life must be more and

more entangled as he goes onward,&mdash;darker and

darker with the ever-deepening misery of this

cruel institution.</p>



<p>Is it a &#8220;<i>merry</i> marriage-bell&#8221; that rings in the

ear of a slave-owning mother for the bridal of

her daughter? Does not her soul recoil from the

possible (probable?) evils before her child; to be

placed, perchance, on an isolated plantation, environed

by natural enemies; to see, it may be, the

brothers and sisters of her own children follow

their slave-mother to the field, or severed from her

to be sold at the slave-market?</p>



<p>Compared with these miseries of the slave-owner,

what are the toils and stripes of the slave? what

his labor without stimulus or requital? what his

degradation to a chattel? what the deprivation of

security to the ties of kindred, and the annulling

of that relation which is their source and chiefest

blessing?</p>



<p>The slave looks forward with ever-growing

hope to the struggle that must come. He joyfully

&#8220;smells the battle afar off.&#8221; The slave-owner

folds his arms, and shuts his eyes in paralyzing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

despair. He hears the fearful threatenings of the

gathering storm. He knows it must come,&mdash;to

him fatally. It is only a question of time!</p>



<p>Who would not &#8220;rather be a slave than a slave-owner?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CAN SLAVES RIGHTFULLY RESIST AND FIGHT?</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not answer this question. But the following

facts are submitted as containing the materials

for an answer.</p>



<p>About seventy years ago, three millions of

people in America thought themselves wronged by

the powers ordained of God. They resolved not

to endure the wrong. They published to the

world a statement of grievances which justified

resistance to the powers ordained of God, and

deliberately revolted against the king, though explicitly

commanded by God to &#8220;honor the king.&#8221;

In the process of revolt, about one hundred thousand

men, Europeans and Americans,&mdash;were

slaughtered in battle, or slowly butchered by the

sickness, imprisonments, and hardships incident to

a state of war.</p>



<p>It was distinctly maintained in 1776, that men

may rightfully fight for liberty, and resist the

powers ordained of God, if those powers destroyed

liberty. Christian men, ministers in their pulpits

strenuously argued that it was men&#8217;s <i>duty</i> to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>

for liberty, and to kill those who opposed them.

Prayer was offered to God for success in this

process of resistance and blood; and good men

implored and obtained help from other nations, to

complete the work of resistance to oppression, and

death to the oppressors.</p>



<p>I do not say that these positions were right, or

that the men of 1776 acted right. But I do say,

that <i>if</i> they were right, we are necessarily led to

some startling conclusions. For there are now

three millions of people of America grievously

wronged by the government they live under. <i>If</i> it

was right in 1776 to resist, fight, and kill, to secure

liberty,&mdash;it is right to do the same in 1852. <i>If</i>

three millions of whites might rightfully resist the

powers ordained of God, then three millions of

blacks may rightfully do the same. <i>If</i> France

was justified in aiding our band of revolutionists

to fight for liberty, then a foreign nation may

lawfully aid men now to vindicate their rights.

<i>If</i>, as the men of 1776 declared, &#8220;when a long

train of abuses evinces a design to reduce them

<i>under absolute despotism</i>, it is their right, it is their

<i>duty</i>, to throw off such government,&#8221;&mdash;then it is

the duty of three millions of men in 1852, to throw

off the government which reduces them to the

frightful and absolute despotism of chattel slavery.</p>



<p>But what were the oppressions, which, in 1776,

justified revolt, battle, and one hundred thousand

deaths? They are stated in the &#8220;Declaration of

Independence,&#8221; are familiar to all, and will therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

only be abridged here. The powers ordained

of God over the men of 1776,&mdash;&#8220;restrained their

trade,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;refused assent to laws enacted by the

local legislature,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;kept soldiers to overawe

them,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;did not punish soldiers for killing a few

colonists,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;imposed taxes without their consent,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;in

some cases, did not allow them trial

by jury,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;abolished good laws,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;made war

on them, in case of disobedience.&#8221;</p>



<p>These were the wrongs they complained of.

But nearly all their rights were untouched. They

had schools and colleges, and could educate their

children; they could become intelligent and learned

themselves; they could acquire property, and large

numbers of them had become rich; they could

emigrate without hindrance to any other country,

when weary of the oppressions of their own; they

could elect their own town and state officers; they

could keep swords, muskets, powder and ball in

their own houses; they could not be lashed and

sold like brutes; they were never compelled to

work without wages; they could appeal to courts

of justice for protection.</p>



<p>Let us now hear a statement of the wrongs

inflicted on three millions of Americans in 1852.</p>



<p>We have no rights left to us.</p>



<p>Laws forbid us to be taught even to read,

and severe penalties are inflicted on those who

teach us.</p>



<p>The natural right of the parent over the child is

wholly taken away; our children are systematically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

kept in profound ignorance, and are worked or

sold like brutes, at the will of slave-holders.</p>



<p>We can acquire no property, and are kept in

utter and perpetual pauperism, dependent on the

mere caprice or selfishness of other men for subsistence.</p>



<p>If we attempt peaceably to emigrate from this

land of oppression, we are hunted by bull-dogs, or

shot down like beasts,&mdash;dragged back to perpetual

slavery without trial by jury.</p>



<p>We are exposed to the most degrading and

revolting punishments, without judge or trial, at

the passion, caprice, or cruelty of the basest

overseers.</p>



<p>When our wives and daughters are seduced or

ravished, we are forbidden to appeal to the courts

of justice.</p>



<p>Whatever outrage may be perpetrated on ourselves

or our families, we have no redress.</p>



<p>We are compelled to work without wages;

the fruits of our labor are systematically extorted

from us.</p>



<p>Many thousands of our people are annually

collected by slave-traders, and sold to distant

States; by which means families are broken up,

and the most frightful debasement, anguish, and

outrage is inflicted on us.</p>



<p>We have no access to courts of justice, no voice

in the election of rulers, no agency in making the

laws,&mdash;not even the miserable remnant of liberty,

in choosing the despot who may have absolute

power over us.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>We are hopelessly consigned to that condition

most revolting and loathsome to one in whom

the least vestige of manly or womanly feeling is

left,&mdash;that of absolute slavery.</p>



<p>The laws treat us not as human beings, but &#8220;as

<i>chattels personal</i>, to all intents, constructions, and

purposes whatsoever.&#8221;</p>



<p>Great numbers of our people, in, addition to all

these enormities, endure unutterable bodily sufferings,

from the cruelty and torturing punishments

inflicted on us.</p>



<p>I do not assert that three millions of people,

suffering such intolerable wrongs and outrages,

ought to throttle their oppressors, and kill fifty

thousand of them. I only say, that <i>if</i> it was right

to do so in 1776, it is also right to do the same in

1852. <i>If</i> the light oppressions which the men of

the last century endured justified war and bloodshed,

then oppressions ten thousand times worse,

would surely justify revolt and blood. <i>If</i> the

colonists might rightfully refuse to &#8220;remain in the

calling wherein they were called,&#8221; as subjects of

the English government, then slaves may rightfully

refuse to continue in the calling wherein

they were called. <i>If</i> three millions of men might

lawfully disregard the text, &#8220;honor the king,&#8221; on

the ground that the king oppressed them; then three

millions of men may lawfully disregard the text,

&#8220;servants, obey your masters,&#8221; on the ground that

those masters grievously oppress them. <i>If</i> the

<i>prospect of success</i> justified the war of 1776, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>

as soon as three millions of slaves feel able and

determined to vindicate their rights, they may

justly demand them at the point of the sword; and

any black Washington who shall lead his countrymen

to victory and liberty, even through carnage,

will merit our veneration. <i>If</i> &#8220;liberty or death&#8221;

was a noble and Christian war-cry in 1776 for the

oppressed, then it would be noble and Christian-like

for the oppressed men of 1852 practically to

adopt the same.</p>



<p>If these inferences appear startling and even

horrible, why do they so appear? Is there any

reason except that inveterate prejudice, which applies

very different principles to the colored man

and to the white man? If three millions of white

men were in slavery in Algiers now, should we

not urge them, as soon as there was hope of success,

to imitate the men of 1776, rise and fight for

liberty? Therefore, until we are prepared to condemn

our ancestors as guilty rebels, and abhor

their insurrection as a wicked resistance to the

ordinance of God, can we blame <i>any class</i> of

people for successful revolt against an oppressive

government?</p>



<p>Let this further question be pondered. Who

were to blame for the destruction of one hundred

thousand lives in the war of 1776? The oppressors,

or the oppressed? The men who fought for liberty,

or the men who would not let them have it without

fighting? Who then would be responsible for the

death of one hundred thousand men, if the oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>

men of 1852 should kill so many, in fighting

for liberty?</p>



<p>If the reader is shocked by such inquiries and

inferences, and as directly and intentionally designed

to encourage servile insurrection and civil

war, he may be assured that my aim is entirely

different. It is my wish, to secure timely precautions

against danger. For we are to remember,

that our slave and colored population is advancing

with the same gigantic rate of increase characteristic

of our country. In twenty-five years, we shall

have six millions of slaves; in fifty years, twelve millions;

in seventy-five years, twenty-four millions.

Can any one dream of the possibility of retaining

twenty-four millions, or twelve millions, of human

beings in slavery? Long before that number is

reached, will not vast multitudes of them learn the

simple lessons of liberty and right, which our

books, orations, and politicians inculcate day by

day? Will there not arise among them men of

courage, genius, enthusiasm, who will, at all hazards,

lead them on to that glorious liberty which

we have taught them is cheaply purchased at any

peril, or war, or bloodshed? When that day

comes, as sure it must, will there not be horrors

such as civil war has never yet produced? Is it

not wise, then, to begin measures for averting so

fearful a catastrophe? Is it not madness to slumber

over such a frightful future? Should not the

talent and energies of the country be directed to

the momentous inquiry, How can slavery <i>now</i> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>

peacefully and rightfully removed? Does not

every attempt to hush agitation, and insist on the

finality of anti-slavery measures, make more sure

the awful fact that slavery is to work out its own

emancipation in fighting and blood?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TRUE REFORM.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> received your appeal, my friends, and

am not sorry to find myself remembered by you.

Every moment of the ages is pregnant with the

fate of humanity, but we are inclined to imagine

that in which we live to have a peculiar significance.

At this hour, it seems to us as if the great

balance of justice swayed to and fro, in most disheartening

uncertainty; but this moment, like all

others, lies in the hollow of God&#8217;s hand, and his

infinite love will not fail to justify to men and

angels its terrible discipline.</p>



<p>I have departed on this occasion from the plan

of action once laid down to myself. I have not

presented you in these pages with the revolting

facts of slavery; for to deal with the subject at

this moment in a fitting manner, demands a prudence

and tact not likely to be possessed by one

absent from the scene of action, and ignorant of

the passing moment. I wish to convey to you the

assurance of my deep sympathy in all Christ-like

opposition to sin; my deep sorrow for every loss

of manly self-control, and failure of faith in God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>

among reformers; my conviction that the Constitution

of the United States, in so far as it is not

in harmony with the law of God, can be no sure

foundation for the law of man; that until it gives

place to a higher ground of union, or until the

nation consent to give it a higher interpretation, it

will depress the national industry, corrupt the

national morals, and palsy the national strength.

It is my firm faith, that man owes his first allegiance

to God, and that it is the duty of every citizen

who disobeys the law of a land, to bear its penalties

with a patience and firmness which shall show him

adequate to the hour, and neither unwilling nor

unfit to complete the sacrifice he has begun. Above

all, O my friends! I pray that God may fill the

hearts of the reformers in this cause, with the

deepest devotion to His absolute truth, the truest

perception of the humility of Christ; that He may

show them how, as its exigencies press, they must

not only be men full of anti-slavery zeal, but filled

with Divine prudence, sincere desirers of that

peace which is founded on purity,&mdash;possessors of

that temperance which is its own best pledge. In

the consciousness of the martyrdom of the affections,

which his position involves, the reformer

feels oftentimes secure of his eternal compensation.

But I have wondered, of late, whether martyrdom

may not be as dangerous to his spiritual life as

worldly renown, or pecuniary prosperity.</p>



<p>Stretched upon the rack, I may still be puffed

up with pride, or an unhealthy spirit of self-dependence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>

and sacrificing my last copper on the altar

of a great truth, I may still refuse to offer there

my personal vanity, my wilful self-esteem, or my

bitterness of temper.</p>



<p>Let us be willing, O my friends! to lay these

also at the feet of Christ.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LETTER FROM WILSON ARMISTEAD TO THE

SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Leeds, 7th mo. 22, 1852.</span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>:&mdash;</p>



<p>In responding to thy welcome communication,

I may say that I rejoice in the cause of the interruption

of our correspondence, so far as it concerns

thyself; thy time and talents being so increasingly

occupied, in union with other of humanity&#8217;s advocates,

in assisting to overturn the monster

iniquity of our age, that crowning crime of

Christendom,&mdash;<i>negro slavery!</i></p>



<p>Go on in this good work! and may God&#8217;s blessing

abundantly attend, till the eternal overthrow

be effected of a system so fraught with every evil;

so abhorrent to the rights of nature, and so contrary

to the spirit of the Gospel;&mdash;till the galling

chain be broken off the necks of America&#8217;s three

million slaves; till its victims be raised from the

profoundest depths of ignorance and woe, to which

they are now degraded.</p>



<p>&#8217;Tis a marvel to me, that a system like that of

negro slavery, which admits of such atrocities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>

can be tolerated for a single hour! Ought not

every one who has a spark of humanity, to say

nothing of Christianity, in his bosom,&mdash;ought not

all the sound part of every community in which

slavery exists to rise up <i>en masse</i>, and declare that,

this abomination shall exist no longer?</p>



<p>Who gave to any man the right to enslave his

fellow man? Can any enactment of human legislators

so far sanction robbery, as lawfully to make

one man the property of another? Has God poured

the tide of life through the African&#8217;s breast, and

animated it with a portion of his own Divine spirit,

and at the same time deprived him of all natural

affections, that <i>he</i> alone is to be struck off the list

of rational beings, and placed on a level with the

brute? Is his flesh marble, and his sinews iron,

or his immortal spirit of a class condemned, without

hope, to penal suffering, that he is called upon

to endure incessant toil, and to be subjected to

degradation, bodily and mental, such as no other

portion of the family of Adam have ever been

destined to endure, without the vengeance of

Heaven being signally displayed upon the oppressors?

Does the African mother feel less love

to her offspring than the white woman? or

the African husband regard with less tenderness

the wife of his bosom? Is his heart dead to the

ties of kindred,&mdash;his nature so brutalized, that

the sacred associations of home and country

awaken no emotions in his breast?</p>



<p>History unanswerably demonstrates that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>

negro does feel, keenly feel, the wrongs inflicted

upon him by his unrighteous enslavers, and that

his mind, barren as it has been rendered by hard

usage, and desolated with misery, is not unwatered

by the pure and gentle streams of natural affection.

Yet the lordly oppressors remain unmoved by the

sad condition of the negro, contemplate with indifference

his bodily and mental sufferings, and

still dare to postpone to an indefinite period the

termination of his oppression and of their own

guilt.</p>



<p>But thanks be to God! there <i>is</i> some counteracting

influence to this feeling, and that it is on

the advance. The night has been long and dark,&mdash;already

the horizon brightens; the day of freedom

dawns.</p>



<p>Go on, then, my friend; I say, go on! in the

good cause thou hast espoused. Labor, and faint

not. &#8220;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it

with all thy might.&#8221; My kind regards to Frederick

Douglass; may he, and all others also, be strengthened

and encouraged to labor in the great work of

human freedom; that so, by gradual increase, like

the mighty surge, they may become strong enough

to overpower and drown the oppressor, and be enabled

to devise and execute measures of mercy

and justice, which may avert the judgments of the

Almighty from their guilty land. For surely some

signal display of Divine displeasure must await

America, unless she repent, and undo the heavy

burdens of her <small>THREE MILLION SLAVES</small>.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Are not the signs of the times calculated to

remind us forcibly of this language of Isaiah,

&#8220;Behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to

punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity;

the earth also shall disclose her blood, and

no more cover her slain.&#8221; Do we not hear already</p>

<div class="verse">&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;the wheels of an avenging God,</div>

<p>Assuredly, he comes to judge the earth. &#8220;Who

shall abide the day of his coming; who shall stand

<h2 class="nobreak">JOHN MURRAY (OF GLASGOW).</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">About</span> a year ago, the newspapers announced

the death of Mr. John Murray, for many years the

secretary of the Glasgow Emancipation Society,

and I would do violence to truth and humanity

whose servant and soldier he was, should I neglect

to pen a few recollections of that most earnest and

efficient man.</p>



<p>He was related to the ancient and honorable

family of the Oswalds of Sheildhall, and received

that excellent educational and religious training

which is given to the children of the middle and

higher classes in Scotland. At the age of twenty-two

or three, in consequence of an attack of pulmonary

hemorrhage, he sailed for the West Indies and

found employment at his trade, house-building, in

St. Kitts. Very soon, however, he found other matters

to engage, and almost engross his attention

and labors; in conjunction with an uncle of George

Stephen of London, and a Dr. Hamilton, resident

in St. Kitts, he did manly and successful fight in

behalf of the wronged and bleeding slave.</p>



<p>After a residence in that island of some years,

during which he obtained a thorough knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>

of the workings of slavery, he returned to Glasgow,

poor in pocket, but rich in abolitionism. Soon

after his return, he was united in marriage to Miss

Anna &mdash;&mdash;, a lady whose perfect harmony in sentiment,

softened by feminine delicacy, made a happy

anti-slavery home for the zealous and ardent abolitionism

of John Murray. It was a union of

hearts attached in early youth, and which had

remained &#8220;leal&#8221; during a long separation.</p>



<p>Shortly after marriage, he commenced business

as a <i>spirit-dealer</i>, then and now a most reputable

calling in the opinion of the good citizens of

Glasgow. Temperate himself, his calling gradually

became unpleasant to him. At first he refused

to sell spirits to any person partly inebriated; then

he reasoned himself into a total abandonment of

the death-dealing traffic. With no other business

prospect before him, prevented by his long difficulty

from working at his trade, with a young wife

and child dependent on him, he suddenly locked

up his spirit-cellar and never more sold rum!</p>



<p>In 1828 or 1829, through the influence of his kinsman,

James Oswald, Esq., of Sheildhall, Mr. Murray

was appointed surveyor on a part of the Forth

and Clyde canal, an office requiring much labor

for little pay. His prospects of promotion depended

on Mr. Oswald and other members of the Kirk of

Scotland. Mr. Murray was a full member of the

Tron Church, Glasgow, when, according to law, a

minister was appointed there regardless of the

choice, and contrary to the wishes of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>

majority of its members. In consequence of this

appointment, and again unmindful of personal advancement,

John Murray shook the dust from his

sandals and quit at once and forever the Tron

Church and the Kirk of Scotland.</p>



<p>About the same time the Glasgow Emancipation

Society was formed or re-organized, on the

doctrine of immediate emancipation so splendidly

announced by a secession minister of Edinburgh.

The secretaries of this association were John Murray

the surveyor, and William Smead, of the Gallowgate,

grocer; the last a Friend. These two

were the head and front, the thinking and the

locomotive power of this well known association

which did notable fight, if not the principal labor,

in effecting emancipation in the British West

Indies, and in assaulting American slavery.</p>



<p>And, twenty odd years ago, it was no trifling

matter to do anti-slavery work in Glasgow, the

very names of whose stateliest streets proclaimed

that they were built by money wrung out of the

blood and sweat of the negroes of Jamaica, St.

Vincents, etc. The whole of the retired wealth,

nearly all the active business influence, the weight

of the Established Church, the rank and fashion

of Glasgow, and though last not least, the keen

wit of the poet Motherwell,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> and the great statistical

learning and industry of M&#8217;Queen were arrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

on the side of the slave-holder. Sugar and

cotton and rum were lords of the ascendant! Yet

the poor surveyor and the humble grocer fought

on; nor did they fight alone; the silvery voice and

keen acumen of Ralph Wardlaw, the earnest and

powerful Hugh Heugh, the inexorable logic and

burning sarcasm of swarthy Wully Anderson, and

the princely munificence of James Johnston, combined

to awaken the people to the enormity of

slavery. And the Voluntary Church movement,

and the fight for the Reform Bill aroused a varied

eloquence in the orators who plead for, and a kindling

enthusiasm in the people who were struggling

on the liberal side of all these questions; for the

people, battling for their own rights, had heart

room to hear the prayer for the rights of others

more deeply oppressed. Thus ever will liberty

be expansive and expanding in the direction of

human brotherhood.</p>



<p>Then <span class="smcap">Knibb</span> came along with his fiery eloquence,

which swept over and warmed the hearts of the

people with indignation at the dishonor done

religion in the martyrdom of the missionary Smith;

and then the grand scene in the British emancipation

drama, the overthrow of Bostwick by George

Thompson, and the monster petitions and the

reluctant assent of the ministry and the passage of

the bill.</p>



<p>Those were stirring times in Glasgow, and it

did one&#8217;s heart good to see John Murray in their

midst. The arrangements for nearly all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>

movements originated with, and were carried out

by him; he never made a speech of one minute

long, yet he most effectively arranged all the speaking,

drew up all the resolutions and reports and

addresses; and most of the movements in England,

the pressure upon the ministry, and the advocacy

in Parliament were the result of his wide

and laborious correspondence. He used more than

one ream of paper for manuscripts upon the great

cause which he seemed born to carry out successfully.

In addition to his other correspondence,

nearly every issue of two of the Glasgow tri-weekly

papers contained able articles from his pen in

reply to the elaborate defence of slavery carried on

in the Glasgow Courier by Mr. M&#8217;Queen. And

yet this man, doing this mighty work, was so entirely

unobtrusive, so quiet in his labors, that few

beyond the committee knew him other than the

silent secretary of the Glasgow Emancipation Society.

And I shall not soon forget the perfect

consternation with which he heard a vote of thanks

tendered him by resolution at an annual meeting

of the society.</p>



<p>In 1835 or 1836, Mr. Murray was promoted to

the office of collector at Bowling Bay, for the company

he had so long and faithfully served. And

many an anti-slavery wayfarer can testify to the

warm welcome and genial hospitality of the snug

little stone building so beautifully packed on the

Clyde entrance of the Forth and Clyde canal. A

charming family, consisting of a devoted wife, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

most promising boys, and a retiring, sweet tempered

girl, made happy the declining years of this

great friend of the slave, and earnest pioneer in

many reforms. Freedom for Ireland, the Peace

Question, Radical Reform, a Free Church, and

Total Abstinence, were questions to all of which

Mr. Murray devoted his pen and his purse. His

soul received and advocated whatever looked

towards human progress.</p>



<p>In person, Mr. Murray was tall and gaunt, and

would strongly remind one of Henry Clay. About

a mile from Bowling Bay, within the enclosure

that surrounds the Relief Church, in a sweet quiet

spot, the green turf now covers what remains of

the once active frame of John Murray; and as,

with moistened cheek, I fling this pebble upon his

cairn, I cannot help thinking how much more has

been done for the cause of human progress by

this faithful servant to his own convictions of the

truth, than by the nation-wept sage of Ashland.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">POWER OF AMERICAN EXAMPLE.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the last anniversary of the American Home

Missionary Society, Rev. John P. Gulliver made

an eloquent address on the duty of bringing the

American people under the full influence of Christian

principle, in an argument drawn from the

bearings of our national example on the people of

other lands. <i>Christianity</i>, he said, <i>alone can make

the nations free</i>. We fully believe in this sentiment.

In answer to the question, <i>How is Christianity

to effect this result?</i>&mdash;Mr. Gulliver&#8217;s answer

was: <span class="smcap">America is to be the agent.</span></p>



<p>Other nations, he thought, might do much in

working out this great result; but the chief hopes

of the friends of freedom, he suggested, are centered

upon this country. The world needs <i>an

example</i>; and he pointed to what the example of

this nation has already done, imperfect as it is.

&#8220;It is doing, at this moment, more to change the

political condition of man than all the armies and

navies,&mdash;than all the diplomacy and king-craft of

the world.&#8221; If it be so, if, as the speaker declared,

&#8220;the battle of the world&#8217;s freedom is to be fought

on our own soil,&#8221; it would be interesting to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

at the obstacles in the way. The United States

must present a very different example from that

exhibited the last twenty-five years, and now

exhibited, before this country will be the agent of

Christianity in evangelizing the world. Think of

three millions of our countrymen in chains!

Think of the large numbers held by ministers of

the gospel and members of churches! Think of

the countenance given to slave-holders by our

ecclesiastical assemblies, by Northern preachers,

by Christian lawyers, merchants, and mechanics!

Think of the platforms, adopted by the two leading

political parties of the country, composed partly

of religious men! Think of the dumbness of

those that minister at the altar, in view of the

great national iniquity, and then consider the

effects of <i>such an example</i> upon other nations,

Christian and Heathen!</p>



<p>Dr. Hawes is stated to have said at the last

annual meeting of the A. B. C. F. M., that Dr.

John H. Rice said, in his hearing, more than

twenty years ago: &#8220;I do not believe the Lord

will suffer the existing type or character of the

Christian world to be impressed on the heathen.&#8221;

We also heard the remark, and believe that Dr.

Rice, in alluding to the state of religion in this country,

said, &#8220;it was so far short of what Christianity

required, that sanguine as many were that the

United States was speedily to be the agent of the

world&#8217;s conversion, he did not believe, for one, that

God would suffer the Christianity of this country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>

as it then was, to be impressed upon the heathen

world.&#8221; If the character of our religion was thus

twenty years ago, what is it now? As a religious

people we have been boastful. We have acted as

if we thought God could not convert the world

without the instrumentality of this country. It is

far more probable that the converted heathen will

send missionaries to the United States to teach us

the first rudiments of Christianity, than that this

country, at the present low ebb of religion, will be

the agent of converting heathen nations to God.</p>



<p>Dr. Hawes believed &#8220;that if the piety of the

church were corrected and raised to the standard

of Paul, God would soon give to the Son the heathen

for his inheritance.&#8221; No doubt of it. Such

piety would do away with chattel slavery, with

caste, with slavery platforms, with ungodly rulers,

with Indian oppression, with divorcing Christianity

from the ballot-box, with heathenism at home.

Let us pray for such piety; and that hundreds of

such men as <span class="smcap">Rice</span> and <span class="smcap">Hawes</span> may lift up their

voices like a trumpet, and put forth corresponding

action, until the nation shall be regenerated

and become fit to enlighten, and, through the grace

of God, save a dying world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;THE GOSPEL AS A REMEDY FOR SLAVERY.&#8221;</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the leading Congregational papers, a

writer, W. C. J., has commenced a series of communications

under the above heading. It is well to

discuss the subject. The writer says, &#8220;There are,

it is true, many among our three millions of slaves

who are acquainted with the rudiments of religious

truth, and are leading lives of sincere piety.&#8221; Dr.

Nelson, a native of a slave State, stated, as the

result of experience for many years, that he had

never known more than three or four slaves who he

had reason to believe were truly and intelligently

pious. The Synod of South Carolina and Georgia

published to the world, some years since, that the

great mass of slaves were heathen, as much so as

the heathen of any portion of the globe. What

authority W. C. J. has for saying there are, among

the three millions of American slaves, &#8220;many&#8221;

who are &#8220;leading lives of sincere piety,&#8221; I do not

know. It is probably the mere conjecture of an

ardent mind. He qualifies the expression by asking,

&#8220;What is the type of the religion that too

generally appears among the slaves?&#8221; And then

replies to his own question, &#8220;It is sickly and weak,

like a plant growing in a cellar, or a cave; a compound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

of sincere piety with much of superstition

and fanaticism.&#8221; What sort of piety is that?</p>



<p>A sagacious observer has remarked, that there

never can be, in our day, intelligent piety where

men are not possessed of property, especially where

they are mere serfs or slaves. How many American

slaves have the piety of &#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; we

are unable to say. Probably very few. And it

must fill the heart of every one who loves the souls

of men, with anguish to contemplate the spiritual

destitution of the slaves in this country; kept in

bondage by the religious and political apathy or

acts of professing Christians, of different denominations,

in their individual or associated capacity.

But to the question: <i>Is the gospel a remedy for

slavery?</i> We answer, unhesitatingly, not such a

gospel as is preached to them; for while it does

very little to enlighten either slave or master, it

enjoins upon the former passive obedience, and inculcates

upon the latter the right and duty of holding

their fellow men in bondage. Nor have we

much hesitation in avowing it as our belief, that

the gospel, as generally preached in the free States,

is quite inadequate to put an end to slavery. It

does not reach the conscience of the tens of thousands

who are, in various ways, connected with

slave-holding by relationship, business correspondence,

or political or ecclesiastical ties. As proof of

this, we need only contemplate the action of the

Northern divisions of the political and religious national

parties. Slavery is countenanced, strengthened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

increased, extended by their connivance or

direct agency. The truth is, Christianity, as promulgated

by the great mass of the preachers and

professors at this day even in the free States, is

not a remedy for slavery. It is a lamentable truth,

one that might justly occasion in the heart of every

true Christian the lamentation of the prophet Jeremiah:

&#8220;Oh that my head were waters, and mine

eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep, day

and night, for the slain of the daughters of my people!&#8221;

And it is in view of this truth, that the

friends of a pure and full gospel have great

encouragement to persevere in their work of faith

and love. The missionaries connected with the

American Missionary Association, at home and

abroad, inculcate, fearlessly and persistently, a gospel

of freedom, and make no more apology or

allowance for slave-holding than for any other sin

or crime. Such missionaries should be sustained,

their numbers augmented, and prayer ascend for

them continually.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WORK AND WAIT.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">My Friend</span>:&mdash;</p>



<p>I have found no moment till the present that I

could devote to a compliance with your request,

and I am now probably too late. However, let

me hastily proffer a few suggestions to opponents

of slavery, which I trust may not be found unprofitable.

I would say, then:</p>



<p>1. Do not choose to separate and isolate yourselves

from the general movement of humanity,

save as you may be constrained to oppose certain

eddies of that movement. Had <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span>,

<span class="smcap">Clarkson</span>, and their associate pioneers in the

cause of British abolition, seen fit to cut themselves

loose from all pre�xisting sects and parties,

and for a special anti-slavery church and party,

I think the triumph of their cause would have

been still unattained.</p>



<p>2. Do not refuse to do a little good because you

would much prefer to do a greater which is now

unattainable. The earth revolves in her vast orbit

gradually; and he who has done whatever good he

can, need not reproach himself for his inability to

do more.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>3. Be foremost in every good work that the

community around you <i>will</i> appreciate,&mdash;not

<i>because</i> they will appreciate it, but because their

appreciation and sympathy will enable you to do

good in other spheres, and do it more effectually.</p>



<p>4. Be pre�minent in your consideration and

regard for the rights and wrongs of labor in your

own circle, even the rudest and humblest. An

abolitionist who hires his linen made up at the

lowest market rate, and pays his wash-woman in

proportion, will do little good to the anti-slavery

or any other philanthrophic cause. The man of

liberal culture and generous heart who unostentatiously

tries to elevate the most depressed to his

own level, is doing a good work against slavery,

however unconsciously.</p>



<p>5. Have faith, with a divine patience; man is

privileged to labor for a good cause, but the glory

of its success must redound to his Maker. Next

to a great defeat, the most fatal event for slavery

would be a great triumph. Doubtless, the bolts

are now forging in some celestial armory destined

to strike the shackles from the limbs of the bondman,

and cleanse the land from the foulest and

blackest iniquity ever organized and legalized in

the christian world. The shout of deliverance may

come when it is least expected,&mdash;nay, the very

means employed to render its coming impossible,

will probably secure and hasten it. For that and

every other needed reform, let the humane and

hopeful strive, not despairing in the densest midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

and realizing that the darkest hour is often

that preceding the dawn. Let them, squandering

no opportunity, and sacrificing no principle,</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;Learn to labor, and to wait.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p class="center">BY ANNIE PARKER.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />



<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;The</span> slaves at Oak Grove did not mourn for

poor Elsie when she died,&#8221; said aunt Phillis, continuing

her narrative. &#8220;She was never a favorite,

and from the time her beauty attracted the notice

of the young master, and he began to pet her, she

grew prouder and prouder, and treated the other

slaves as if she were their mistress, rather than

their equal. They hated her for her influence

over the master, and she knew it, and that made

matters worse between them.</p>



<p>&#8220;When she died in giving birth to her second

child, her little boy and I were the only ones who

felt any sorrow. The master had grown tired of

her, though he had once been very fond of her.

Besides, he was at this time making arrangements

for his marriage with a beautiful Northern lady, so

that whatever he might have felt, nobody knew

anything about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Elsie was my younger sister. I loved her

dearly, and had been almost as proud as she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>

of her remarkable beauty. Her little boy was very

fond of his mother, and she doated upon him. He

mourned and mourned for her, after her death, till

I almost thought he would die too. He was a

beautiful boy, and at that time looked very much

like his father, which was probably the reason why

the master sold him, before he brought his bride to

Oak Grove.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was very hard for me to part with poor Elsie&#8217;s

little boy. But the master chose to sell him, and

my tears availed nothing. Zilpha, Elsie&#8217;s infant,

was given me to take care of when her mother

died, and with that I was obliged to be content.</p>



<p>&#8220;Marion Lee, the young mistress, was very beautiful,

but as different from poor Elsie as light from

darkness. She had deep blue eyes, with long

silken lashes, and a profusion of soft brown hair.

She always made me think of a half-blown rosebud,

she was so delicate and fair. She proved a

kind and gentle mistress. All the slaves loved her,

as well they might, for she did everything in her

power to make them comfortable and happy.</p>



<p>&#8220;When she came to Oak Grove, she chose me to

be her waiting-maid. Zilpha and I occupied a

large pleasant room next to her dressing-room.</p>



<p>&#8220;She made a great pet of Zilpha. No one ever

told her that she was her husband&#8217;s child. No

one would have dared to tell her, even if she had

not been too much beloved, for any one to be

willing to grieve her, as the knowledge of this fact

must have done.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;In due time she, too, had a little girl, beautiful

like herself. Zilpha was delighted with the baby.

She never wearied of kissing its tiny hands, and

talking to it in her sweet coaxing tones. Mrs.

Lee said Zilpha should be Ida&#8217;s little maid. The

children, accordingly, grew up together, and when

they were old enough to be taught from books,

everything that Ida learned, Zilpha learned also.</p>



<p>&#8220;When Zilpha was seventeen, she was more

beautiful than her mother had ever been, and she

was as gentle and loving as Elsie had been passionate

and proud. There was a beautiful, pleading

look in her large dark eyes, when she lifted

the long lashes so that you could see into their

clear depths. She was graceful as a young fawn,

and playful as a kitten, and she had read and

studied so many books, that <i>I</i> thought she knew

almost as much as the master himself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Minturn lived at Lilybank, the estate joining

Oak Grove. He was an old friend of Mr. Lee,

and the families were very intimate. About this

time a relative of Mrs. Minturn died at the far

South, and left her a large number of slaves. I

don&#8217;t know how they were <i>all</i> disposed of, but one

of the number, a very handsome young man,

named Jerry, was brought to Lilybank, and

became Mr. Minturn&#8217;s coachman. He was considered

a great prize, for he had a large muscular

frame, and was capable of enduring a great amount

of bodily fatigue. He was, also, for a slave, very

intelligent, and from being at first merely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

coachman, he soon became the confidential servant

of his master.</p>



<p>&#8220;Owing to the intimacy between the heads of

the two families, the young people of both were

much together. Ida often spent whole days at

Lilybank, and as Zilpha always accompanied her,

she had ample opportunity to become acquainted

with the new man Jerry.</p>



<p>&#8220;It so happened that I, being more closely confined

by my duties at home, had never seen Jerry,

when in the summer following his coming to Lilybank,

Mrs. Lee went to visit her friends at the

North, and took me with her. Ida and Zilpha

remained at home. We were gone three months.

A few days after our return, Zilpha told me that

she was soon to be married to Jerry. The poor

child was very happy. She had evidently given

him her whole heart. We talked long that day,

for I wanted to know how it had been brought

about, and she told me all, with the simplicity and

artlessness of a child. They had felt great anxiety

lest their masters should oppose the marriage.

But that fear was removed. Mr. Lee had himself

proposed it, and Mr. Minturn gladly consented. I

rejoiced to see my darling so happy, and felt truly

thankful to God that the warm love of her heart

had not been blighted.</p>



<p>&#8220;That same evening Jerry came to see Zilpha.

She called me immediately, for I had never seen

him, and she wished us to meet. The moment I

looked upon his face, I knew he was my poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>

Elsie&#8217;s son. I grew sick and faint, and thought I

should have fallen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Zilpha made me sit down, and brought me a glass

of water, wondering all the time, poor thing, what

had made me ill so suddenly. I soon recovered

sufficiently to remember that I must not betray

the cause of my agitation. I did not speak much,

but watched Jerry&#8217;s face as closely as I could,

without arresting their attention. Every moment

strengthened the conviction that my suspicion was

correct. There was the same proud look that

Elsie had, the same flashing eye, and slightly curled

lip, and when he carelessly brushed back the

hair from his forehead, I saw a scar upon it, which

I knew was caused by a fall but a little while

before his mother died. O God! I thought, what

will become of my darling child!</p>



<p>&#8220;I soon left the room, on the pretence that my

mistress wanted me, but really that I might shut

myself into my own room and think. I did not

close my eyes that night, and when the morning

dawned, I was as far as ever from knowing what

I ought to do. At last I resolved to see the master

as early as I could, and tell him all.</p>



<p>&#8220;After breakfast I went to the library to fetch

a book for my mistress, and found the master there.

He was reading, but looked up as I entered, and

said kindly, &#8216;What do you wish for, Phillis?&#8217; I

named the book my mistress wanted. He told

me where it was. I took it from the shelf, and

stood with it in my hand. The opportunity which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>

I desired had come, but I trembled from head to

foot, and had no power to speak. I don&#8217;t know

how I ever found words to tell him that Jerry was

his own child. I tried, afterwards, to remember

what I said, but I could not recall a word. He

turned deadly pale, and sat for some minutes

silent. At length in a low, husky voice, he said,

&#8216;You will not be likely to speak of this, and it is

well, for it must not be known. I shall satisfy

myself if what you have told me is true. If I find

that it is, I shall know what to do. You may go.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I took the book to my mistress, and was sent by

her to find Zilpha. She was in the garden with

Ida, and when I called her, she came bounding

towards me with such a bright, happy face, that

I could scarcely restrain my tears. Zilpha was a

beautiful reader. She often read aloud to her mistress,

by the hour together. I liked to take my

sewing and sit with them at such times, but that

day I was glad to shut myself up alone in my

room.</p>



<p>&#8220;The next day the master sent for me to the

library. &#8216;It is true, Phillis,&#8217; he said to me,

&#8216;Jerry is without doubt poor Elsie&#8217;s child.&#8217; If

an arrow had pierced my heart at that moment, I

could not have felt worse, for though I had

thought I was sure it was so, all the while a hope

was lingering in my heart that I was mistaken.

I did not speak, and the master seeing how I trembled,

kindly told me to sit down, and went on; &#8216;I

did not see Jerry myself, he said, Mr. Minturn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

made all necessary inquiries for me. Jerry remembers

his mother, and describes her in a way that

admits of no mistake. He remembers, too, that a

gentleman used sometimes to visit his mother, who

took a great deal of notice of him, and would

let him sit upon his lap and play with his watch

seals. His mother used to be very happy when

this gentleman came, and when he went away she

would almost smother the little boy with kisses,

and talk to him of his papa. I offered to buy

Jerry, but Mr. Minturn would not part with him.

If he would have consented, I might easily have

disposed of the whole matter.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;A horrible fear took possession of me at these

words. Would he <i>dare</i> to sell my darling Zilpha?

The thought almost maddened me. Scarce knowing

what I did, I threw myself on my knees before

him, and begged him not to think a second time

of selling his own flesh and blood. He angrily

bade me rise, and not meddle with that in which I

had no concern. That he had a right, which he

should exercise, to do what he would with his

own. He had thought it proper, he said, to tell

me what I had just heard, but charged me never

again to name the subject to any living being, and

not to let any one suspect from my appearance that

anything unusual had occurred. With this he

dismissed me.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I suffered during that dreadful week, is

known only to God. I could neither eat nor

sleep. It seemed to me I should lose my reason.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;Jerry came once to Oak Grove, but I would not

see him. Zilpha I avoided as much as possible.

I could not bear to look upon her innocent happiness,

knowing as I did that it would soon be

changed into unspeakable misery.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first three days the master was away from

home. On Thursday he returned. When I

chanced to meet him, he looked uneasy; and if he

came to his wife&#8217;s room and found me with her,

he would make some excuse for sending me away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Saturday was a beautiful bright October day,

and Ida proposed to Zilpha that they should take

their books and spend the forenoon in the woods.

They went off in high spirits. I thought I had

never seen my Zilpha look so lovely. Love and

happiness had added a softer grace to her whole

being. I followed them to the door, and she kissed

me twice before leaving me; then looking back,

when she had gone a little way, and seeing me

still standing there, she threw a kiss to me with

her little hand, and looked so bright and joyous,

that my aching heart felt a new pang of sorrow.

What was it whispered to me then that I should

never see her again?</p>



<p>&#8220;I went back to my work, and presently the master

came and asked for Ida. He wished her to

ride with him. I told him where she was, and he

went in search of her. Zilpha did not come back

with them. &#8216;We told her to stay if she wished,&#8217;

Ida said. But my heart misgave me. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

at once have gone in search of her, but Mrs. Lee

wanted me, and I could not go.</p>



<p>&#8220;I cannot bear, even now, to recall the events of

that day. My worst fears were realized. During

my master&#8217;s absence, he had sold my darling to a

Southern trader, who only waited a favorable

opportunity to take her away without the knowledge

of the family. He had been that morning

with Mr. Lee, and was in the house when Mr.

Lee returned with Ida from the woods.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how the master ever satisfied

his wife and Ida about Zilpha&#8217;s disappearance.

There was a report that she had run away. But

I don&#8217;t think they believed it. Certainly <i>I</i> never

did.</p>



<p>&#8220;I almost forgot my own sorrow when I saw

how poor Jerry felt when he knew what had happened.

Of course he did not know what I did.

He <i>never</i> knew why Zilpha was sent away, but he

knew she was sold, and that there was little reason

to hope he should ever see her again. He went

about his work as usual, but there was a look in

his eye which made one tremble.</p>



<p>&#8220;Before many days he was missing, and though

his master searched the country, and took every

possible means to find him, he could discover no

trace of the fugitive. I felt satisfied he had followed

the North Star, but I said nothing, and was

glad the poor fellow had gone from what would

constantly remind him of Zilpha.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;During the following winter, Mrs. Lee had a dangerous

illness. I watched over her night and day,

and when she recovered, my master was so grateful

for what I had done, that he gave me my freedom,

and money enough to bring me to the North.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of Zilpha&#8217;s fate I have been able to learn

nothing. I can only leave her with God, who

though his vengeance is long delayed, hears and

treasures up every sigh and tear of his poor slave-children.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw, a few days since, a man who knows Jerry.

He is living not many miles from me, and I shall

try to see him before I die. But I shall never tell

him the whole extent of the wrongs he suffered

in slavery.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MAN-OWNER.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">A friend</span> of mine, on the &mdash;&mdash; day of &mdash;&mdash;,

18&mdash;, (the dates it is unnecessary to specify,)

became the owner of a man. He had never owned

one before; and he has had so much trouble with

him, that I doubt if he will ever allow himself to

become owner of one again. My friend is not a

Southerner; yet the circumstances by which so

singular a dispensation fell to him, it is unnecessary

for me to recount. I will briefly describe the

master and the man, and show how they succeeded

in their relationship.</p>



<p>The master was wholly respectable in his life

and character; endowed with good sense; well

enough off in the world, able to hire service, if he

needed, and to pay for it: his temper not bad,

though sometimes irritable;&mdash;he could be provoked

as others can. He had strong passions,

and sometimes in the course of his life they had

got the better of him, and had led him to conduct

which, in the coolness of his mind, he bitterly

repented. Circumstances might have made a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>

man of him. The instructions which he received

in his childhood, the example of his parents, the

respectable neighborhood in which he resided, the

church which he attended, all had a favorable influence

upon him. So he became a man of principle.

He had not, indeed, the highest principles;

he was no hero; he was not disposed to

make himself a martyr. His religion was no

other than the common religion of the church to

which he was attached, and it demanded no peculiar

sacrifice of him. He was a member of one

of the leading political parties, and did his full

duty in maintaining its cause. He called himself

a patriot, however, not a partizan; and talked

ever of his country, as the highest exemplification

of the great principles of liberty, and considered

the success of our institutions as the hope

of humanity. Yet he loved his country,&mdash;not

his race. He was not without charity to the poor;

and was not unwilling to see them, individually,

rising above destitution. Yet he did not like to

associate with men lower in the social scale than

himself; but had an ambition that impelled him

to court the society of those whose station and

influence were superior to his own. Nor did he

care for, or believe in, any suggestions or plans,

the object of which was the elevation of the poor

as a class, and the levelling upwards of the human

race. He thought that as a divine authority

has declared to us, &#8220;ye have the poor with you

always,&#8221; it was ordained that we should always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>

have them,&mdash;that they were an exceedingly useful

class, as a foundation in society, that the prosperous

men of the world could not do without

them, and that it was not best to give them too

much hope of rising.</p>



<p>Perhaps you will say I have given you no very

definite description of him. You will think, perhaps,

were I called to write of him again, I might,

at once, better make use of the words of the poet,</p>



<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">



<div class="verse">The annals of the human race,</div>

<div class="indent">Their ruins, since the world began,</div>

<div class="verse">Of him afford no other trace</div>

<div class="indent">Than this,&mdash;<small>THERE LIVED A MAN!</small></div>

</div></div>



<p>I fear, however, that I shall be unable to be

more particular in my description of the servant;

It is said, &#8220;like master, like man,&#8221; and, indeed,

leaving out the expressions above, which show the

relationship of the master to the community and

the church, the description of temper and of

general, moral, and religious principle, would

answer to be repeated now. Suffice it to say,

the man was not bad; that is, not thoroughly bad.

He cherished no secret desire for liberty. His

master had no real fear of his attempting to escape.

He loved his master; and some thought, who did

not wholly know him, that never slave loved a

master with more fondness and devotion. Yet I

know that he was often disobedient. Passages,&mdash;not

of arms,&mdash;but of ill-temper, of reproach, and

of insolence, not unfrequently occurred between

them. High words were used, hard looks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

moody oftener still, perhaps, yet the master never

struck his servant, nor did the servant ever offer

violence towards his master. But at times, they

would have been very glad to part company, if

the one could have easily escaped, or the other

could have made out to do without him. Much

of the disobedience which gave serious offence to

the master, was the result of inadvertence. Lessons,

the most frequently enjoined, were forgotten; they

were not always listened to with an obedient

mind. Years long the master required this or that

service from day to day, and yet the command was

not once a year, I may say, attended to. Always

the master was saying,&mdash;&#8220;to-morrow I shall turn

over a new leaf with him;&#8221; but he had not energy

enough to carry his purpose into effect. He intended

to give his servant at least some moral education,

to teach him self-control, to prevent his bursts

of passion, not by the infliction of punishment, but

by a true moral discipline; yet the work was

always delayed, and never accomplished. You

will say, the master had himself some idle fancies

that he ought not to have indulged, and that a

severer course would have been more successful.

But he was one of those who doubt the advantages

and shrink from the application of severity,

and he would have been no more prompt and

resolute and persevering with his servant than

with himself.</p>



<p>At the commencement, I seemed to promise a

story. But all my narrative is closed with a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>

more. The master was at the age of twenty-one,

when he came into possession of his man. The

connection will never be dissolved, except, at least,

by death. Indeed, reader, if you have not already

seen it, master and man were but one and the

same person.</p>



<p>And this is the moral of my little fiction. Who

will believe that any man ought to have the ownership

of another, when it is so rare to find one of

us wholly competent to govern and to own himself?

Nay, the better a man is, and the more

qualified to direct and to govern others with absolute

sway, the less is he willing to take the

responsibility of the disposal of them,&mdash;but seeing

his own unfitness for the office of lord, even

of himself, he prays, not that he may be a master

of others, but himself a servant of God.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DAMASCUS IN 1851.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">No</span> city has been more variously described than

Damascus, because none has more contrasted features.

A spruce Yankee, hearing &#8220;Silk Buckingham&#8217;s&#8221;

description of his &#8220;Paradise,&#8221; and seeing

merely narrow, half-paved, mat-covered streets,

and dirty, mud-walled buildings, would prefer his

native &#8220;Slabtown&#8221; to the &#8220;most refreshing scene

in all our travels.&#8221; And yet Damascus is one of

the wonders of the world, unrivalled in what is

peculiarly its own, admitting no comparison with

any existing city, revelling in a beauty and a splendor

belonging to Islamism more than Christianity,

characterizing the age of the Caliphs rather than

of the Crystal Palace.</p>



<p>In antiquity it has no rival. Nineveh, Babylon,

Palmyra, its contemporaries, have wholly perished;

while this oldest inhabited place has lost none of its

population, yielded none of its local pre�minence,

abandoned but one of the arts for which it was so

renowned, and taken not a tinge of European

thought, worship, life. It numbers not far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

one hundred and fifty thousand souls, of whom

twenty thousand may be Greek and Armenian

Christians. It lies in an exquisite garden at the

foot of Anti-Lebanon, in a plain of inexhaustible

fertility, watered by innumerable brooklets from

those ancient streams &#8220;Abana and Pharphar,&#8221;

and shut in by vast groves of walnut and poplar,

a &#8220;verdurous wall of Paradise,&#8221; which are all that

the traveller sees for hours as he draws near the

city of &#8220;Abraham&#8217;s steward.&#8221;</p>



<p>Originally the seat of a renowned kingdom, and

once the capital of the Saracen empire, it is now

the centre of an Ottoman Pashalik, but virtually

the metropolis of Syria, as it was in the earliest

time. Miss Martineau and some others carelessly

give it a length of seven miles; but the real extent

of the city-walls in any one direction is not more

than two. The gardens and groves around, however,

take the same name, and are over twenty

miles in circuit, of a studied, picturesque wildness,

shaded lanes, running side by side with merry

brooks, the whole overshadowed by the deepest

forest, and forming delicious relief from the sunburnt

plains of Syria. Besides the walnut, so

much prized for its fruit all through the East, and

the poplar, the main dependence for building, the

famous damson, or Damascene plum, abounds the

citron, orange, and pomegranate spread their fruit

around the vine is everywhere seen, and only three

miles off stands the forest of damask rose-trees

whence the most delicious attar is made. But a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>

genuine American will prefer the walnut-tree to

all others, because of its freedom of growth, massiveness

of trunk, depth of shade, and impressive

reminiscence of home. These trees, together with

the mulberry, do very much for the commerce of

the city. But, indeed, Damascus is the chief depot

of manufactures for Syria. Silk goods cannot be

bought to such advantage elsewhere, nor of such

antique patterns, nor of genuine &#8220;damask&#8221; colors.

The business has suffered somewhat of late,

because Turkish husbands discovering that English

prints are so much cheaper, and their wives

fancying the flowing calicoes to be so much prettier

than the patterns which their grandmothers

wore, foreign goods are supplanting the domestic;

and a macadamized road is contemplated from the

city to its seaport Beiroot, whose effect would be

to make British and French manufactures still

more common, but, at the same time, to give free

circulation to the handicraft of Damascus. As at

Constantinople, Cairo, and elsewhere, each trade

occupies its own quarter, the jewellers, pipe-makers,

silk-dealers, grocers, saddlers, having each

their exclusive neighborhood; none of the Bazars

are such noble edifices as cluster around the

mosque of St. Sophia; and in the rainy season

(that is, during their winter) the pavement is so

wretched and slippery, and such a mass of mud

and water oozes down from the rotten awnings,

that one does no justice to the unequalled richness

of some of the fabrics and the grandeur of some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

the khans. One traveller informs the public that

there is a grand &#8220;Bazar for wholesale business&#8221; of

variegated black and white marble, &#8220;surmounted

by an ample dome,&#8221; with a lively fountain in

the centre. There are <i>thirty-one</i> such buildings,

which <i>we</i> should call Exchanges, bearing each the

name of the Sultan who erected them. Those

that I visited were contiguous to the only street

which wears a name in the East, and that name,

familiar to us in the book of Acts, &#8220;Strait,&#8221; Dritto,

as your guide mumbles the word, a long avenue

containing the only hotel in the city.</p>



<p>An oriental peculiarity which makes the large

towns exceedingly interesting is, that every occupation

is carried on out of doors, and right under

your eyes as you stroll along. Here the silk web

is stretched upon the outside wall of some extended

building; here the butcher is dressing the

meat, perhaps for your dinner, right upon the sidewalk;

and here a sort of extempore sausage is

cooking, so that one might almost eat it as he

walks, a capital idea for hasty eaters, and a very

nice article in its way. There is no other part of

the world where so much cooking is to be seen all

the while, and such loads of sweetmeats gladden

the eyes of childhood, and such luscious compounds,

scented with attar, spread temptation before every

sense. The business of &#8220;El-Shans&#8221; might almost

be headed by the five hundred public bakers,

though the silk is still the principal manufacture,

and there are reported to be seven hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>

forty-eight dealers in damask, thirty-four silk-winders,

one hundred silk dyers, and one hundred and

forty-three weavers of the same article.</p>



<p>The famous Damascus blades are nothing but

an &#8220;antiquity&#8221; now,&mdash;they are uniformly called so

by the people, were offered to our purchase in very

small quantities by persons who knew nothing of

their manufacture, at exorbitant prices, and in

very uncouth forms. They appeared to be curiosities

to them, as they certainly were to us, and are

said to be sometimes manufactured in England.

A mace, offered for sale among these scimetars of

wavy steel, smacked of the Crusaders&#8217; time, and

was richly inlaid with gold; the fire-arms, or blunderbusses,

were grotesque and unwieldy, richly

mounted, and gorgeously ornamented.</p>



<p>An attempt is making in certain quarters to persuade

the civilized world that Turkey has still

some military power. Of this almost imperial

city the citadel is but a mass of ruins. Count

Guyon, a confederate general with Kossuth, and

now a Turkish Pasha and drill-officer, assured us it

would be repaired and strengthened; but the city-walls

offer no defence against a modern army; and

the Turkish soldier, notwithstanding his courage

and endurance, cannot be bastinadoed into military

science; neither have educated Christian officers, like

Guyon, any real influence. I frequently saw the

sentinels asleep while upon duty, and recent

experience has proved them incapable of standing

before a far smaller amount of really trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

troops. Some of the barracks at Damascus are

rather the finest which the Sultan possesses, and

among the best in the world,&mdash;some, too, of the

military exercises are pursued with a creditable

zeal,&mdash;but, on the whole, a more slatternly corps

of men was never seen, nor one less confident in

themselves.</p>



<p>The christian curiosities of this oldest of inhabited

cities, begin with the mosque of peculiar

sanctity, once the site of St. John&#8217;s Cathedral,

whose chamber of relics, containing a pretended

head of the Baptist, is inaccessible even to Mussulmen,

the priesthood excepted. Six huge Corinthian

columns, once a part of its proud portico,

are built into houses and stores, so that you get

but faint glimpses of their beauty and size until

you mount the flat mud-roof of the modern buildings

and look down into the vast area of the temple,

six hundred and fifty-feet by one hundred and

fifty; and there find towering above you these

massive, blackened remains of Christian architecture,&mdash;significant

emblems of the triumph of the

Crescent over the Cross,&mdash;and yet by their imperishableness

a promise of renewed glory in some

brighter future. That Islamism is hastening to

decay is shown impressively enough in the grand

dervish mosque and khan, once quite celebrated

as the Syrian enthronement of this advanced

guard of Mohammed; now nothing could seem

more deserted, one minaret is threatening to fall,

the spacious garden is all weed-grown, and few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>

are left to mourn over the reverse: these banner-men

of the prophet, no longer warriors, students,

and apostles, do but beg their bread and drone

their prayers, and exchange the reputation of fanatics

for that of hypocrites; they are in fact monks

of the mosque, like their brothers in celibacy,

changing sadly enough from enthusiasm to formality,

from the fervor of first love to the grave-like

chillness of an exhausted ritual.</p>



<p>St. Paul is of course the great name at Damascus;

and your dragoman is very certain always as

to the place where he was lowered down the city-wall;

then he takes you to the tomb of the soldier

who befriended him, close at hand, and to the little

underground chapel where the Apostle&#8217;s sight was

restored. But having passed in turn under the

sceptre of Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Jew,

Roman, Arabian, Turk, every stone of these buildings

could tell a most interesting tale, and every

timber of the wall could answer with an experience

corresponding to the out-door revolution.</p>



<p>But the grand attractions in this &#8220;Flower of the

Levant and Florence of Turkey&#8221; are the coffee-houses,

and the palaces of the rich. The writer

of Eothen, I think it is, says, &#8220;there is one coffee-house

at Damascus capable of containing a hundred

persons:&#8221; a Damascus friend, a resident clergyman,

carried me into one where he had himself

seen, three thousand people on a gala-day, and

several where hundreds of visitors would not make

a crowd. This great necessity of Turkish life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

this deliverance from the loneliness of an oriental

home, this luxurious substitute for the daily newspaper,

is carried to perfection here. First of all,

comes the lofty dome-covered hall, surrounded by

couches like beds, enlivened on all festivals by the

Arabian Improvisator with his song and his tale;

back of this are a number of rude arbors interlaced

with noble shade-trees, and watered profusely by

nimble brooks, the whole lighted every night by

little pale lamps. These are the gossiping places

for the Damascene gentlemen; where the fragrant

tch�bouque, the cool narghilch, or water-pipe, the

delicious coffee, the indolent game at dominos,

(I never saw chess played at the east,) is relieved

by such domestic anecdotes as, according to my

American friend, brand the domestic life of the

city with beastly sensuality.</p>



<p>One would fain hope that these are the prejudices

of an earnest missionary,&mdash;but until the

residence of years had given familiarity with the

language, any opinions of a visitor would be

erroneous as well as presuming. Nothing, however,

can bring back so powerfully the Arabian

tales of enchantment as the interior of the wealthier

Damascus houses. The outside is always mean

and forbidding. You have sometimes to stoop

under the rude, low gate; and the first court, surrounded

only by servants&#8217; rooms, has nothing of

interest. But the second and third quadrangles

become more and more spacious, and are always

of variegated marble, containing a perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>

playing fountain, overhung by the orange, the

citron, and the vine, whose fragrance floats dreamily

on the moist air, lulling the senses to repose.

The grand saloon I found to be always arranged

pretty much the same. A lower part of the pavement

near the door, is the place of deposit for

slippers, shoes, and the pattens which Damascus

women use so much in the winter, articles all of

them never intended for ornament, and never fitted

to the foot, but worn as loose as possible, and

never within the sitting-room, but simply as a protection

from out-door wet and soil. The lower

portion of the room and its rug-strewn floor are of

variegated marbles, then comes curiously carved

woods, then painted stucco, decorated with mirrors

rising to the distant gay-colored roof. The immense

loftiness, the moist coolness, the gorgeous hues,

the emblazoned texts from the Koran, the sweet

murmur of the various fountains, the fragrance of

the orange groves, succeed to the out-door dreariness

like a dream of Haroun Al Raschid to the

wearied pilgrim on desert sands. The divan, or

wide sofa, on three sides of this hall, is far more

agreeable in this enervating climate than any

European furniture; only, in winter, as the ground

underneath is permeated by leaky clay tubes bearing

the waters of the Barrady, and there is no

other heating apparatus save a brazer of charcoal,

one is sometimes very chilly, and is tempted to

exchange this tomblike dampness for a cozy corner

near some friendly stove or familiar fire-place.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>But the general impression which unintelligent

strangers carries from Damascus is, that the people

have what they want, and have gone wisely to

work to realize their idea of earthly blessedness,&mdash;an

indolent, sensual, dreamy one to you, but in

their eyes no faint type of the Mussulman&#8217;s

heaven.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is morally wrong, cannot be made practically

right. The laws of morality are taught in

the Bible. They are unchangeable truths. No

sophistry, no expediency, no compromise can set

them aside.</p>



<p>If politics is the science of government, and if

civil government is a divine institution, intended

to protect the rights of all; if &#8220;an injury done to

the meanest subject, is an injury done to the

whole body;&#8221; and if &#8220;rulers must be just, ruling

in the fear of God,&#8221; all legislation should be based

on moral duty. Any enactments that have not

this basis, are, in the Divine sight, null and void.

If man is endowed by nature with inalienable

rights, no legislation can rightfully wrest them

from him. Any attempt to do it, is an infraction

of the moral law. Our religious, moral, and political

duties are identical and inseparable. It is the

duty of all christian legislators so to act <i>now</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

they know all must act, when truth and righteousness

<h2 class="nobreak">WHY SLAVERY IS IN THE CONSTITUTION.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>





<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the constitution of a country should guide

its action is a <i>truism</i> which none, perhaps, will be

inclined to controvert. Indeed, so thoroughly is

this sentiment inwrought into us, that we generally

expect <i>practice</i> will conform to the constitution.

But does not this subject States or nations to

misapprehension by others? South Carolina, for

instance, abolishes the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> with

regard to the colored people, and imprisons them,

although citizens of the other States, when they

enter her borders in any way. Now these are

direct violations of the constitution of the United

States, so direct, that they cannot be explained

away. Nor do we think that South Carolina

even attempts it. She openly says, that it is

owing to the existence of slavery among them,

that the <i>free</i> colored man, coming into contact

with the slaves, will taint them with notions of

liberty which will make them discontented,&mdash;that

therefore her own preservation, the first law of

nature, requires her to do everything she can to

keep the disturbing force out of her limits, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

she have to violate the constitution of the United

States. This she asserts, too, when, at the formation

of the constitution, she was one of the large

slave-holding States,&mdash;when she had before her the

example of every nation that had practised slavery,

and when now her senators and representatives in

Congress are sworn to support the constitution of

the Union. Thus we see that it would be doing

injustice to the constitution, were we to judge of

it by the practice of South Carolina.</p>



<p>But the inquirer will not be satisfied with the

South Carolina reason. He wants something

more and better. He says, too, that these give

good occasion to those exercising the powers of

the government to confirm all law-abiding citizens

in the belief that they are well protected by the

constitution, and to let the world see how much

the United States prize it. But supposing he

were told that those who control the government

feel, in this matter, with South Carolina,&mdash;that

those who had the control of the government had

no power to coerce South Carolina to perform her

duty,&mdash;indeed, in a partizan view, that the person

injured were <i>no</i> party,&mdash;that, as a general thing,

they could not even vote,&mdash;were unimportant,

nay, insignificant. If those reasons will not satisfy

him, he must be content with them, for it is not

likely that he will get any other. We further see

that injustice would be done by considering the

<i>practice</i> of a people as fairly representing their

constitution.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>A constitution,&mdash;the organic-law,&mdash;in truth, all

other law is, in some degree, a restraint on men.

It makes an umpire of right,&mdash;of reason,&mdash;which,

if not the same in degree in all of us, is the same

in nature. Yet it must be, to some extent, a

restraint on the desires or selfish passions of men.

In fact, it is only carrying out the rule of doing to

others what they should do to us, and tends not

only to preserve, but advance society. If no constitution

or law agreeing with it existed, men would

be left to the sway of their own passions&mdash;nearly

always selfish&mdash;and they being many and very

different in different persons, sometimes, indeed,

altogether opposite, and of various intensity,&mdash;would,

by their indulgence, tend to confusion, to

the deterioration of society, and to its ultimate

dissolution.</p>



<p>Now the people of the United States, without

the least hesitation declare,&mdash;and they fully believe

it&mdash;that we are the freest nation on earth. Other

nations, doubtless, with equal sincerity say of themselves

the same thing. In England where, as in

other countries of the old world, there is a crowded

population, raising to a high price everything eatable,

the <i>operatives</i>, as they are called, find it

difficult to sustain life. They work all the time

they can, and, even after doing this, they sometimes

perish for want of such food as a human

being ought to eat. No one will say that affairs

are well ordered here. Having no such state of

things ourselves&mdash;for except in some of our large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>

cities, no one starves to death&mdash;we think that to

suffer one to die in this way is cruel and heartless.

And we greatly upbraid them for it.</p>



<p>But here we have slavery,&mdash;a vicious usage

which European nations, excepting one, have long

since laid aside. This they have done not only

because it was productive of innumerable visible

evils, but because it greatly and injuriously affected

the character of all concerned in it, and in this

way the character of the whole community,&mdash;making

one part of it proud and imperious,&mdash;another

suppliant and servile. They upbraid us

with it, as being more inconsistent with the high

principles we profess, than any act tolerated among

them is or can be with the principles they profess.

Then whilst we wonder that with so much wealth

as England unquestionably has, she should suffer

her operatives to die for something to eat, she

wonders that slavery&mdash;the worst thing known

among men&mdash;should be permitted to raise its

head, not only as high as the many good and exalted

things we possess, but above them, making

them, when necessary, give way to it and even contribute

to its support. Indeed, it appears to them

like Satan appearing in company with the sons of

God, to accuse and try one of his children.</p>



<p>But all this is of no avail. It produces no satisfying

results,&mdash;in fact nothing but mutual ill-will

and irritation. It is no difficult thing to select

from the <i>practices</i> of many people such as are

not what they ought to be,&mdash;still the theory, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>

foundation of the government may be opposed to

them, but may be unable to put them down.

They may exist in spite of it, and in entire opposition

to its <i>main</i> object. Indeed, it appears to be

much like reasoning in a circle. We come to no

end,&mdash;no conclusion. To come to any satisfactory

end,&mdash;any useful conclusion,&mdash;we must

take something permanent,&mdash;something believed

by both to be unchangeably right and moral, and

compare our governments with it. Whichever

comes nearest to the standard agreed on by both,

must of course be nearest right. But what shall

this be? Now as it is utterly in vain for one to

be happy unless he conform to the laws of his being,

so it is in vain that governments are instituted

unless they aim to secure the happiness and safety

of the governed,&mdash;the people. The peculiar benefit

or enrichment of those that administer the

laws, has nothing to do with good government.

Then it ought, by all means, to resemble the

Divine government. We do not mean a <i>theocracy</i>

as it has been administered, the worst, perhaps,

of all governments,&mdash;but it should be remarkable

for its sacred regard to justice and right.</p>



<p>But it is objected, this deals with persons as

individuals and not as members of the body politic,

and that all Christ&#8217;s exhortations were of this

kind. Well, be it so,&mdash;what of it? There is not

the least danger, if one will acquit himself well in

his various relations as an individual,&mdash;a <small>MAN</small>,&mdash;but

what he will make a good citizen.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Taking this as our standard, and recurring for a

moment to the assertion of our superior happiness

as a people&mdash;an assertion sometimes regarded as

the boastful grandiloquence of our people&mdash;is it

not true that our government, <i>our constitution of

government we mean</i>, more nearly resembles the

Divine government than any other does, and

<i>therefore</i>, that those under it <i>are</i> more happy?

Some, while they are inclined to admit the fact

of our superior happiness, yet seem rather to attribute

it to our great abundance of land than to

the nature of the government. We do not wish,

in any way, to deny or even to neutralize this

statement about the abundance of our land, but

still it is one of the <i>facts</i> of the government,&mdash;the

government was made with this in view,&mdash;it

constitutes a subject for its action, and it makes

of it a strong auxiliary. This, though undeniably

a <i>great</i> cause, is not, in our judgment, the <i>chief</i>

one. It is intellect,&mdash;mind united to such feelings

and desires that most advance others to be

like God in intelligence and worth,&mdash;that makes

the chief cause. Where this <i>is</i> not,&mdash;or is not

called forth and put into activity, nothing to purpose

can be done. Indeed, it is the most powerful

agent for good anywhere to be found,&mdash;for it

is behind all others, and sets all others to work.</p>



<p>We have among us here no form of religion, as

they have in other countries, to which one must

conform before he can have any share in the

government,&mdash;no religion that is made part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>

government, and which is, therefore, <i>national</i>.

Religion&mdash;how we shall serve or worship a

Being or beings superior to ourselves, and who are

thought to influence our destiny forever&mdash;is, certainly,

the highest concern of man. As no church

or nation can answer for him at the judgment-seat,

he ought to be left free on this matter. On

this point he is free in this country, he is under

no necessity to think in a particular channel. In

his inquiries after truth, he has nothing to fear from

the government about the changes through which

his mind may pass, or the conclusions to which

it maybe led; although he may draw on him the

prejudice and hatred of the sects from whom he

feels compelled to differ.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> We may truly say, that

in this country, however far we may go in imitating

foreign forms, we have nothing higher than

the preacher of the truth.</p>



<p>We have no monarch <i>born</i> to rule over us,

whether we will or not; nor are we obliged to

support this costly leech according to <i>his</i> dignity

by money wrung from the labor of the country,

nor a host of relatives according to <i>their</i> dignity,

as connected with the monarch.</p>



<p>Nor have we a class <i>born</i> to be our legislators.

We have no legislative castes, nor social castes,

but we may truly say, that any native-born citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

of the United States may aspire to any position,

be it governmental or social.</p>



<p>Nor have we fought so long&mdash;though it must

be confessed we are ready pupils here&mdash;as most

of the countries of the old world have; still we

begin to make fighting almost a part of the government,

and a part of the religion of the land. But

all this does not answer the question that many

have asked, and that our intelligence and exemption

from bias in many things make more remarkable,&mdash;why

did we suffer slavery to find a place

in a constitution in which there are so many good

things,&mdash;why did we make a garden of healthful

fruits and enchanting flowers, and place this

serpent in it?</p>



<p>The answer to this question may be easily given

by one that well knows the condition of the country

that soon followed on the treaty of 1783. Till

we were governed by the present constitution we

were governed by the Articles of Confederation.

The United States, though nominally a nation,

had no power to enforce any stipulation she might

make. For instance,&mdash;if she should promise by

a treaty to pay interest on the debt that we had

contracted to secure our national independence,

each State by its <i>own</i> power and authority were

to raise its quota of the whole amount. If a State

failed to raise it, the <i>United States</i> had no redress.

It had no authority to coerce any State, no matter

what was the cause of failure. This is given as

only an instance, and did we not think it made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

our position very plain, others might be given in

manifold abundance,&mdash;all tending to show the

unfaithfulness of the States to the engagements of

the United States, and the utter powerlessness of

the latter to keep her word. It was owing to this

that the <i>main</i> object of the Convention was the

more perfect union of the States, and that in this

way there might be conferred on the United States

the same plenary power to carry out her engagements

that a State had to carry out hers.</p>



<p>The Convention did not meet to do away with

slavery, but chiefly to form such a union as would

obviate the difficulty already mentioned, and so

keenly felt by some of the most earnest friends of

the country. Although slavery was pretty well

understood then, and seen to be opposed to all

the principles of freedom asserted, yet as it had

been embraced by so many, that if they should

be united against the constitution its adoption

would be endangered, it was thought best not to

insist on its instant abolition. Men as yet had

too much selfishness in them, and although reasonable

beings, they have too much of the animal in

them to see that, in the long run, honesty is the

best policy. Many of the opponents of slavery,

even from the slave States themselves, took this

opportunity of showing the baseness and turpitude

of the whole system,&mdash;its advocates from

the far South defending it as well as they could.

These advocates gave it as their opinion, that

owing to the Declaration of 1776, one which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>

already done wonders at the North,&mdash;owing to

the influence of the principles of liberty inserted

into the constitution, and to the feeling of justice

pervading all classes of persons, and to the

progress of refinement and true civilization, slavery

would ultimately disappear.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>At the time this opinion was expressed by the

conventionists from the South, although we cultivated

cotton to a small extent, it could not be

regarded as a staple. Soon after making the constitution,

it began to be important. It could be

produced only at the South. As it grew in value,

the notion of abolishing slavery began to wane,

till now some of the leading men of that part of

the country say it is not only a good thing, but an

indispensable one to the highest perfection of the

social system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> well-sweep of the old house on the hill was

relieved, dark and clear, against the reddening sky,

as the early winter sun was going down in the

west. It was a brisk, clear, metallic evening; the

long drifts of snow blushed crimson red on their

tops, and lay in shades of purple and lilac in

the hollows; and the old wintry wind brushed

shrewdly along the plain, tingling people&#8217;s noses,

blowing open their cloaks, puffing in the back of

their necks, and showing other unmistakable indications

that he was getting up steam for a real

roystering night.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hurra! how it blows!&#8221; said little Dick Ward,

from the top of the mossy wood-pile.</p>



<p>Now Dick had been sent to said wood-pile, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>

company with his little sister Grace, to pick up

chips, which, every-body knows, was in the olden

time considered a wholesome and gracious employment,

and the peculiar duty of the rising generation.

But said Dick, being a boy, had mounted

the wood-pile, and erected there a flag-staff, on

which he was busily tying a little red pocket-handkerchief,

occasionally exhorting Gracie &#8220;to

be sure and pick up fast.&#8221; &#8220;O, yes, I will,&#8221; said

Grace; &#8220;but you see the chips have got ice on

&#8217;em, and make my hands so cold!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O! don&#8217;t stop to suck your thumbs!&mdash;who

cares for ice? Pick away, I say, while I set up

the flag of Liberty.&#8221;</p>



<p>So Grace picked away as fast as she could,

nothing doubting but that her cold thumbs were

in some mysterious sense an offering on the

shrine of Liberty; while soon the red handkerchief,

duly secured, fluttered and snapped in the

brisk evening wind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now you must hurra, Gracie, and throw up

your bonnet,&#8221; said Dicky, as he descended from

the pile.</p>



<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t it lodge down in some place in the

wood-pile?&#8221; suggested Gracie, thoughtfully.</p>



<p>&#8220;O, never fear; give it to me, and just holler

now, Gracie, &#8216;Hurra for Liberty;&#8217; and we&#8217;ll throw

up your bonnet and my cap; and we&#8217;ll play, you

know, that we were a whole army, and I&#8217;m General

Washington.&#8221;</p>



<p>So Gracie gave up her little red hood, and Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>

swung his cap, and up they both went into the

air; and the children shouted, and the flag snapped

and fluttered, and altogether they had a merry

time of it. But then the wind&mdash;good-for-nothing,

roguish fellow!&mdash;made an ungenerous plunge at

poor Gracie&#8217;s little hood, and snipped it up in a

twinkling, and whisked it off, off, off,&mdash;fluttering

and bobbing up and down, quite across a wide,

waste, snowy field, and finally lodged it on the

top of a tall strutting rail, that was leaning very

independently, quite another way from all the other

rails of the fence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now see, do see!&#8221; said Gracie; &#8220;there goes

my bonnet! What will Aunt Hitty say?&#8221; and

Gracie began to cry.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you cry, Gracie; you offered it up to

Liberty, you know,&mdash;it&#8217;s glorious to give up

everything for Liberty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O! but Aunt Hitty won&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t cry, Gracie, you foolish girl! Do

you think I can&#8217;t get it? Now, only play that

that great rail was a fort, and your bonnet was a

prisoner in it, and see how quick I&#8217;ll take the fort,

and get it!&#8221; and Dick shouldered a stick, and

started off.</p>



<hr class="tb" />



<p>&#8220;What upon &#8217;arth keeps those children so long?

I should think they were making chips!&#8221; said

Aunt Mehetabel; &#8220;the fire&#8217;s just a-going out

under the tea-kettle.&#8221;</p>



<p>By this time Gracie had lugged her heavy basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>

to the door, and was stamping the snow off

her little feet, which were so numb that she

needed to stamp, to be quite sure they were yet

there. Aunt Mehetabel&#8217;s shrewd face was the

first that greeted her, as the door opened.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gracie&mdash;what upon &#8217;airth!&mdash;wipe your nose,

child; your hands are frozen. Where alive is

Dick, and what&#8217;s kept you out all this time,&mdash;and

where&#8217;s your bonnet?&#8221;</p>



<p>Poor Gracie, stunned by this cataract of questions,

neither wiped her nose nor gave any answer;

but sidled up into the warm corner, where grandmamma

was knitting, and began quietly rubbing

and blowing her fingers, while the tears silently

rolled down her cheeks, as the fire made their former

ache intolerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Poor little dear!&#8221; said grandmamma, taking

her hands in hers; &#8220;Hitty shan&#8217;t scold you.

Grandma knows you&#8217;ve been a good girl,&mdash;the

wind blew poor Gracie&#8217;s bonnet away;&#8221; and

grandmamma wiped both eyes and nose, and gave

her, moreover, a stalk of dried fennel out of her

pocket, whereat Gracie took heart once more.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mother always makes fools of Roxy&#8217;s children,&#8221;

said Mehetabel, puffing zealously under

the tea-kettle. &#8220;There&#8217;s a little maple sugar in

that saucer up there, mother, if you will keep giving

it to her,&#8221; she said, still vigorously puffing.

&#8220;And now, Gracie,&#8221; she said, when, after a while,

the fire seemed in tolerable order, &#8220;will you

answer my question?&mdash;Where is Dick?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&#8220;Gone over in the lot, to get my bonnet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How came your bonnet off?&#8221; said Aunt Mehetabel.

&#8220;I tied it on firm enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Dick wanted me to take it off for him, to throw

up for Liberty,&#8221; said Grace.</p>



<p>&#8220;Throw up for fiddlestick! just one of Dick&#8217;s

cut-ups, and you was silly enough to mind him!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why, he put up a flag-staff on the wood-pile,

and a flag to Liberty, you know, that papa&#8217;s fighting

for,&#8221; said Grace, more confidently, as she saw

her quiet, blue-eyed mother, who had silently

walked into the room during the conversation.</p>



<p>Grace&#8217;s mother smiled, and said, encouragingly,

&#8220;And what then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why, he wanted me to throw up my bonnet

and he his cap, and shout for Liberty; and then

the wind took it and carried it off, and he said I

ought not to be sorry if I did lose it,&mdash;it was an

offering to Liberty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And so I did,&#8221; said Dick, who was standing

as straight as a poplar behind the group; &#8220;and I

heard it in one of father&#8217;s letters to mother, that

we ought to offer up everything on the altar of

Liberty! And so I made an altar of the wood-pile.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good boy!&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;always remember

everything your father writes. He has offered

up everything on the altar of Liberty, true enough;

and I hope you, son, will live to do the same.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Only, if I have the hoods and caps to make,&#8221;

said Aunt Hitty, &#8220;I hope he won&#8217;t offer them up

every week&mdash;that&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8220;O! well, Aunt Hitty, I&#8217;ve got the hood,&mdash;let

me alone for that. It blew clear over into the

Daddy Ward pasture-lot, and there stuck on the

top of the great rail; and I played that the rail

was a fort, and besieged it, and took it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O! yes, you&#8217;re always up to taking forts, and

anything else that nobody wants done. I&#8217;ll warrant,

now, you left Gracie to pick up every blessed

one of them chips!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Picking up chips is girl&#8217;s work,&#8221; said Dick;

&#8220;and taking forts and defending the country is

men&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And pray, Mister Pomp, how long have you

been a man?&#8221; said Aunt Hitty.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I a&#8217;nt a man, I soon shall be; my head is

&#8217;most up to my mother&#8217;s shoulder, and I can fire

off a gun too. I tried, the other day, when I was

up to the store. Mother, I wish you&#8217;d let me

clean and load the old gun; so that, if the British

should come!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if you are so big and grand, just lift me

out that table, sir,&#8221; said Aunt Hitty, &#8220;for its past

supper-time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dick sprung, and had the table out in a trice,

with an abundant clatter, and put up the leaves

with quite an air. His mother, with the silent

and gliding motion characteristic of her, quietly

took out the table-cloth and spread it, and began

to set the cups and saucers in order, and to put on

the plates and knives, while Aunt Hitty bustled

about the tea.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad when the war&#8217;s over, for one reason,&#8221;

said she. &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty much tired of drinking

sage-tea, for one, I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Aunt Hitty, how you scolded that pedler,

last week, that brought along that real tea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To be sure I did. S&#8217;pose I&#8217;d be taking any

of his old tea, bought of the British?&mdash;fling every

tea-cup in his face, first!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, mother,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I never exactly

understood what it was about the tea, and why

the Boston folks threw it all overboard.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because there was an unlawful tax laid upon

it, that the government had no right to lay. It

wasn&#8217;t much in itself; but it was a part of a

whole system of oppressive meanness, designed

to take away our rights, and make us slaves of a

foreign power!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Slaves!&#8221; said Dicky, straightening himself

proudly. &#8220;Father a slave!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But they would not be slaves! They saw

clearly where it would all end, and they would

not begin to submit to it in ever so little,&#8221; said the

mother.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, if I was they,&#8221; said Dicky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; said his mother, drawing him towards

her, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t for themselves alone they did it.

This is a great country, and it will be greater and

greater: and it&#8217;s very important that it should

have free and equal laws, because it will by and

by be so great. This country, if it is a free one,

will be a light of the world,&mdash;a city set on a hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>

that cannot be hid; and all the oppressed and distressed

from other countries shall come here to

enjoy equal rights and freedom. This, dear boy,

is why your father and uncles have gone to fight,

and why they do stay and fight, though God

knows what they suffer, and&mdash;&#8221; and the large

blue eyes of the mother were full of tears; yet a

strong, bright beam of pride and exultation shone

through those tears.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, well, Roxy, you can always talk, every-body

knows,&#8221; said Aunt Hitty, who had been not

the least attentive listener of this little patriotic

harangue; &#8220;but, you see, the tea is getting cold,

and yonder I see the sleigh is at the door, and

John&#8217;s come,&mdash;so let&#8217;s set up our chairs for supper.&#8221;</p>



<p>The chairs were soon set up, when John, the

eldest son, a lad of about fifteen, entered with a

letter. There was one general exclamation, and

stretching out of hands towards it. John threw it

into his mother&#8217;s lap;&mdash;the tea-table was forgotten,

and the tea-kettle sang unnoticed by the fire,

as all hands piled themselves up by mother&#8217;s chair

to hear the news. It was from Captain Ward,

then in the American army, at Valley Forge.

Mrs. Ward ran it over hastily, and then read it

aloud. A few words we may extract: &#8220;There is

still,&#8221; it said, &#8220;much suffering. I have given

away every pair of stockings you sent me, reserving

to myself only one; for I will not be one whit

better off than the poorest soldier that fights for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>

his country. Poor fellows! it makes my heart

ache sometimes to go round among them, and see

them with their worn clothes and torn shoes, and

often bleeding feet, yet cheerful and hopeful, and

every one willing to do his very best. Often the

spirit of discouragement comes over them, particularly

at night, when, weary, cold, and hungry, they

turn into their comfortless huts, on the snowy

ground. Then sometimes there is a thought of

home, and warm fires, and some speak of giving

up; but next morning out comes Washington&#8217;s

general orders,&mdash;little short note, but it&#8217;s wonderful

the good it does! and then they all resolve to

hold on, come what may. There are commissioners

going all through the country to pick up supplies.

If they come to you, I need not tell you

what to do. I know all that will be in your hearts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There, children, see what your father suffers,&#8221;

said the mother, &#8220;and what it costs these poor soldiers

to gain our liberty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ephraim Scranton told me that the commissioners

had come as far as the Three-mile Tavern,

and that he rather &#8217;spected they&#8217;d be along here

to-night,&#8221; said John, as he was helping round the

baked beans to the silent company at the tea-table.</p>



<p>&#8220;To-night?&mdash;Do tell, now!&#8221; said Aunt Hitty.

&#8220;Then it&#8217;s time we were awake and stirring.

Let&#8217;s see what can be got.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send my new over-coat, for one,&#8221; said

John. &#8220;That old one an&#8217;t cut up yet, is it, Aunt

Hitty?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Aunt Hitty; &#8220;I was laying out to

cut it over, next Wednesday, when Desire Smith

could be here to do the tailoring.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the south room,&#8221; said Aunt Hitty, musing;

&#8220;that bed has the two old Aunt Ward blankets

on it, and the great blue quilt, and two comforters.

Then mother&#8217;s and my room, two pair&mdash;four

comforters&mdash;two quilts&mdash;the best chamber

has got&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O! Aunt Hitty, send all that&#8217;s in the best

chamber. If any company comes, we can make

it up off from our beds!&#8221; said John. &#8220;I can send

a blanket or two off from my bed, I know;&mdash;can&#8217;t

but just turn over in it, so many clothes on,

now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aunt Hitty, take a blanket off from our bed,&#8221;

said Grace and Dicky, at once.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, well, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Aunt Hitty, bustling

up.</p>



<p>Up rose grandmamma, with great earnestness,

now, and going into the next room, and opening

a large cedar-wood chest, returned, bearing in her

arms two large snow-white blankets, which she

deposited flat on the table, just as Aunt Hitty was

whisking off the table-cloth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mortal! mother, what are you going to do?&#8221;

said Aunt Hitty.</p>



<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I spun those, every thread

of &#8217;em, when my name was Mary Evans. Those

were my wedding blankets, made of real nice

wool, and worked with roses in all the corners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

I&#8217;ve got <i>them</i> to give!&#8221; and grandmamma stroked

and smoothed the blankets, and patted them

down, with great pride and tenderness. It was

evident she was giving something that lay very

near her heart; but she never faltered.</p>



<p>&#8220;La! mother, there&#8217;s no need of that,&#8221; said

Aunt Hitty. &#8220;Use them on your own bed, and

send the blankets off from that;&mdash;they are just as

good for the soldiers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I shan&#8217;t!&#8221; said the old lady, waxing

warm; &#8220;&#8217;t an&#8217;t a bit too good for &#8217;em. I&#8217;ll send

the very best I&#8217;ve got, before they shall suffer.

Send &#8217;em the <i>best</i>!&#8221; and the old lady gestured

oratorically!</p>



<p>They were interrupted by a rap at the door, and

two men entered, and announced themselves as

commissioned by Congress to search out supplies

for the army. Now the plot thickens. Aunt

Hitty flew in every direction,&mdash;through entry-passage,

meal-room, milk-room, down cellar, up

chamber,&mdash;her cap-border on end with patriotic

zeal; and followed by John, Dick, and Gracie, who

eagerly bore to the kitchen the supplies that she

turned out, while Mrs. Ward busied herself in

quietly sorting, bundling, and arranging in the best

possible travelling order, the various contributions

that were precipitately launched on the kitchen

floor.</p>



<p>Aunt Hitty soon appeared in the kitchen with

an armful of stockings, which, kneeling on the

floor, she began counting and laying out.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said, laying down a large bundle

on some blankets, &#8220;that leaves just two pair apiece

all round.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;La!&#8221; said John, &#8220;what&#8217;s the use of saving

two pair for me? I can do with one pair, as well

as father.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; said his mother; &#8220;besides, I

can knit you another pair in a day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And I can do with one pair,&#8221; said Dicky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yours will be too small,&#8221; young master, I guess,

said one of the commissioners.</p>



<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dicky; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a pretty good foot

of my own, and Aunt Hitty will always knit my

stockings an inch too long, &#8217;cause she says I grow

so. See here,&mdash;these will do;&#8221; and the boy shook

his, triumphantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;And mine, too,&#8221; said Gracie, nothing doubting,

having been busy all the time in pulling off

her little stockings.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; she said to the man who was packing

the things into a wide-mouthed sack; &#8220;here&#8217;s

mine,&#8221; and her large blue eyes looked earnestly

through her tears.</p>



<p>Aunt Hitty flew at her.&mdash;&#8220;Good land! the

child&#8217;s crazy! Don&#8217;t think the men could wear

your stockings,&mdash;take &#8217;em away!&#8221;</p>



<p>Gracie looked around with an air of utter desolation,

and began to cry. &#8220;I wanted to give them

something,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather go barefoot on

the snow all day, than not send &#8217;em anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Give me the stockings, my child,&#8221; said the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>

soldier, tenderly. &#8220;There, I&#8217;ll take &#8217;em, and show

&#8217;em to the soldiers, and tell them what the little

girl said that sent them. And it will do them as

much good as if they could wear them. They&#8217;ve

got little girls at home, too.&#8221; Gracie fell on her

mother&#8217;s bosom completely happy, and Aunt Hitty

only muttered,</p>



<p>&#8220;Everybody does spile that child; and no wonder,

neither!&#8221;</p>



<p>Soon the old sleigh drove off from the brown

house, tightly packed and heavily loaded. And

Gracie and Dicky were creeping up to their little

beds.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been something put on the altar of

Liberty to-night, hasn&#8217;t there, Dick?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Dick; and, looking up to

his mother, he said, &#8220;But, mother, what did you

give?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; said the mother, musingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, you, mother; what have you given to

the country?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All that I have, dears,&#8221; said she, laying her

hands gently on their heads,&mdash;&#8220;my husband and

my children!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.&mdash;THE ALTAR OF &mdash;&mdash;, OR 1850.</h3>



<p>The setting sun of chill December lighted up

the solitary front window of a small tenement on

&mdash;&mdash; street, which we now have occasion to visit.

As we push gently aside the open door, we gain

sight of a small room, clean as busy hands can

make it, where a neat, cheerful young mulatto

woman is busy at an ironing-table. A basket full

of glossy-bosomed shirts, and faultless collars and

wristbands, is beside her, into which she is placing

the last few items with evident pride and satisfaction.

A bright, black-eyed boy, just come in from

school, with his satchel of books over his shoulder,

stands, cap in hand, relating to his mother how he

has been at the head of his class, and showing his

school-tickets, which his mother, with untiring

admiration, deposits in the little real china tea-pot,&mdash;which,

as being their most reliable article of

gentility, is made the deposit of all the money and

most especial valuables of the family.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, Henry,&#8221; says the mother, &#8220;look out and

see if father is coming along the street;&#8221; and she

begins filling the little black tea-kettle, which is

soon set singing on the stove.</p>



<p>From the inner room now daughter Mary, a

well-grown girl of thirteen, brings the baby, just

roused from a nap, and very impatient to renew

his acquaintance with his mamma.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>&#8220;Bless his bright eyes!&mdash;mother will take him,&#8221;

ejaculates the busy little woman, whose hands are

by this time in a very floury condition, in the incipient

stages of wetting up biscuit,&mdash;&#8220;in a

minute;&#8221; and she quickly frees herself from the

flour and paste, and, deputing Mary to roll out her

biscuit, proceeds to the consolation and succor of

young master.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, Henry,&#8221; says the mother, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have

time, before supper, to take that basket of clothes

up to Mr. Sheldin&#8217;s;&mdash;put in that nice bill, that

you made out last night. I shall give you a cent

for every bill you write out for me. What a comfort

it is, now, for one&#8217;s children to be gettin&#8217;

learnin&#8217; so!&#8221;</p>



<p>Henry shouldered the basket, and passed out

the door, just as a neatly-dressed colored man

walked up, with his pail and white-wash brushes.</p>



<p>&#8220;O, you&#8217;ve come, father, have you?&mdash;Mary,

are the biscuits in?&mdash;you may as well set the

table, now. Well, George, what&#8217;s the news?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing, only a pretty smart day&#8217;s work.

I&#8217;ve brought home five dollars, and shall have as

much as I can do, these two weeks;&#8221; and the

man, having washed his hands, proceeded to count

out his change on the ironing-table.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it takes you to bring in the money,&#8221;

said the delighted wife; &#8220;nobody but you could

turn off that much in a day!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, they do say&mdash;those that&#8217;s had me once&mdash;that

they never want any other hand to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>

hold in their rooms. I s&#8217;pose its a kinder practice

I&#8217;ve got, and kinder natural!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell ye what,&#8221; said the little woman, taking

down the family strong box,&mdash;to wit, the china

tea-pot, aforenamed,&mdash;and pouring the contents

on the table, &#8220;we&#8217;re getting mighty rich, now!

We can afford to get Henry his new Sunday-cap,

and Mary her muslin-de-laine dress;&mdash;take care,

baby, you rogue!&#8221; she hastily interposed, as young

master made a dive at a dollar bill, for his share

in the proceeds.</p>



<p>&#8220;He wants something, too, I suppose,&#8221; said the

father; &#8220;let him get his hand in while he&#8217;s young.&#8221;</p>



<p>The baby gazed, with round, astonished eyes,

while mother, with some difficulty, rescued the

bill from his grasp; but, before any one could at

all anticipate his purpose, he dashed in among the

small change with such zeal as to send it flying all

over the table.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hurra!&mdash;Bob&#8217;s a smasher!&#8221; said the father,

delighted; &#8220;he&#8217;ll make it fly, he thinks;&#8221; and,

taking the baby on his knee, he laughed merrily,

as Mary and her mother pursued the rolling coin

all over the room.</p>



<p>&#8220;He knows now, as well as can be, that he&#8217;s

been doing mischief,&#8221; said the delighted mother,

as the baby kicked and crowed uproariously;&mdash;&#8220;he&#8217;s

such a forward child, now, to be only six

months old!&mdash;O, you&#8217;ve no idea, father, how

mischievous he grows,&#8221; and therewith the little

woman began to roll and tumble the little mischief-maker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>

about, uttering divers frightful threats,

which appeared to contribute, in no small degree,

to the general hilarity.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come, come, Mary,&#8221; said the mother, at last,

with a sudden burst of recollection; &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t

be always on your knees fooling with this child!&mdash;Look

in the oven at them biscuits.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re done exactly, mother,&mdash;just the

brown!&#8221;&mdash;and, with the word, the mother dumped

baby on to his father&#8217;s knee, where he sat contentedly

munching a very ancient crust of bread, occasionally

improving the flavor thereof by rubbing it

on his father&#8217;s coat-sleeve.</p>



<p>&#8220;What have you got in that blue dish, there?&#8221;

said George, when the whole little circle were

seated around the table.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, now, what <i>do</i> you suppose?&#8221; said the

little woman, delighted;&mdash;&#8220;a quart of nice oysters,&mdash;just

for a treat, you know. I wouldn&#8217;t tell you

till this minute,&#8221; said she, raising the cover.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said George, &#8220;we both work hard for

our money, and we don&#8217;t owe anybody a cent;

and why shouldn&#8217;t we have our treats, now and

then, as well as rich folks?&#8221;</p>



<p>And gayly passed the supper hour; the tea-kettle

sung, the baby crowed, and all chatted and

laughed abundantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said George, wiping his mouth,

&#8220;wife, these times are quite another thing from

what it used to be down in Georgia. I remember

then old Mas&#8217;r used to hire me out by the year;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>

and one time, I remember, I came and paid him

in two hundred dollars,&mdash;every cent I&#8217;d taken.

He just looked it over, counted it, and put it in his

pocket-book, and said, &#8216;You are a good boy,

George,&#8217;&mdash;and he gave me <i>half-a-dollar</i>!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to know, now!&#8221; said his wife.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, he did, and that was every cent I ever

got of it; and, I tell you, I was mighty bad off for

clothes, them times.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, well, the Lord be praised, they&#8217;re over,

and you are in a free country now!&#8221; said the wife,

as she rose thoughtfully from the table, and brought

her husband the great Bible. The little circle

were ranged around the stove for evening prayers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Henry, my boy, you must read,&mdash;you are a

better reader than your father,&mdash;thank God, that

let you learn early!&#8221;</p>



<p>The boy, with a cheerful readiness, read, &#8220;The

Lord is my shepherd,&#8221; and the mother gently

stilled the noisy baby, to listen to the holy words.

Then all kneeled, while the father, with simple earnestness,

poured out his soul to God.</p>



<p>They had but just risen,&mdash;the words of Christian

hope and trust scarce died on their lips,&mdash;when lo!

the door was burst open, and two men entered;

and one of them advancing, laid his hand on the

father&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;This is the fellow,&#8221; said he.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are arrested in the name of the United

States!&#8221; said the other.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, what is this?&#8221; said the poor man,

trembling.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;Are you not the property of <i>Mr. B.</i>, of Georgia?&#8221;

said the officer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I&#8217;ve been a free, hard-working

man, these ten years.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, but you are arrested, on suit of Mr. B.,

as his slave.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shall we describe the leave-taking?&mdash;the sorrowing

wife, the dismayed children, the tears, the

anguish,&mdash;that simple, honest, kindly home, in a

moment so desolated! Ah, ye who defend this

because it is law, think, for one hour, what if this

that happens to your poor brother should happen

to you!<span class="gapleft">*</span><span class="gapleft">*</span><span class="gapleft">*</span><span class="gapleft">*</span><span class="gapleft">*</span></p>







<p>It was a crowded court-room, and the man stood

there to be tried&mdash;for life?&mdash;no; but for the life

of life&mdash;for liberty!</p>



<p>Lawyers hurried to and fro, buzzing, consulting,

bringing authorities,&mdash;all anxious, zealous, engaged,&mdash;for

what?&mdash;to save a fellow-man from

bondage?&mdash;no; anxious and zealous lest he might

escape,&mdash;full of zeal to deliver him over to slavery.

The poor man&#8217;s anxious eyes follow vainly the

busy course of affairs, from which he dimly learns

that he is to be sacrificed&mdash;on the altar of the

Union; and that his heart-break and anguish, and

the tears of his wife, and the desolation of his

children, are, in the eyes of these well-informed

men, only the bleat of a sacrifice, bound to the

horns of the glorious American altar!<span class="gapleft">*</span><span class="gapleft">*</span><span class="gapleft">*</span><span class="gapleft">*</span></p>



<p>Again it is a bright day, and business walks

brisk in this market. Senator and statesman, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>

learned and patriotic, are out, this day, to give

their countenance to an edifying and impressive,

and truly American spectacle,&mdash;the sale of a man!

All the preliminaries of the scene are there; dusky-browed

mothers, looking with sad eyes while

speculators are turning round their children,&mdash;looking

at their teeth, and feeling of their arms; a

poor, old, trembling woman, helpless, half-blind,

whose last child is to be sold, holds on to her

bright boy with trembling hands. Husbands and

wives, sisters and friends, all soon to be scattered

like the chaff of the threshing-floor, look sadly on

each other with poor nature&#8217;s last tears; and

among them walk briskly glib, oily politicians, and

thriving men of law, letters, and religion, exceedingly

sprightly and in good spirits,&mdash;for why?&mdash;it

isn&#8217;t <i>they</i> that are going to be sold; it&#8217;s only

somebody else. And so they are very comfortable,

and look on the whole thing as quite a matter-of-course

affair; and, as it is to be conducted to-day,

a decidedly valuable and judicious exhibition.</p>



<p>And now, after so many hearts and souls have

been knocked and thumped this way and that way

by the auctioneer&#8217;s hammer, comes the <i>instructive</i>

part of the whole; and the husband and father,

whom we saw in his simple home, reading and

praying with his children, and rejoicing, in the

joy of his poor ignorant heart, that he lived in a

free country, is now set up to be admonished of

his mistake.</p>



<p>Now there is great excitement, and pressing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>

see, and exultation and approbation; for it is important

and interesting to see a man put down

that has tried to be a <i>free man</i>.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s he, is it?&mdash;Couldn&#8217;t come it, could

he?&#8221; says one.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, and he will never come it, that&#8217;s more,&#8221;

says another, triumphantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t generally take much interest in scenes

of this nature,&#8221; says a grave representative;&mdash;&#8220;but

I came here to-day for the sake of the

<i>principle</i>!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; says the auctioneer, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got

a specimen here that some of your Northern abolitionists

would give any price for; but they shan&#8217;t

have him!&mdash;no! we&#8217;ve looked out for that. The

man that buys him must give bonds never to sell

him to go North again!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go it!&#8221; shout the crowd, &#8220;good!&mdash;good!&mdash;hurra!&#8221;

&#8220;An impressive idea!&#8221; says a senator;

&#8220;a noble maintaining of principle!&#8221; and the man

is bid off, and the hammer falls with a last crash

on his hearth, and hopes, and manhood, and he

lies a bleeding wreck on the altar of Liberty!</p>



<p>Such was the altar in 1776;&mdash;such is the altar

in 1850!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OUTLINE OF A MAN.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">In</span> some of those castle-building day-dreams, in

which, like all youth of an imaginative turn, I was

wont, in my early days, to indulge, a favorite image

of my creation was an <i>Africo-American for the

time</i>,&mdash;a colored man, who had known by experience

the bitterness of slavery, and now by some

process free, so endowed with natural powers, and

a certain degree of attainments, all the more rare

and effective for being acquired under great disadvantages,&mdash;as

to be a sort of Moses to his oppressed

and degraded tribe. He was to be gifted with a

noble person, of course, and refinement of manners,

and some elegance of thought and expression; by

what unprecedented miracle such a paragon was

to be graduated through the educational appliances

of American slavery, imagination did not trouble

herself to inquire. She was painting fancy-pieces,

not portraits.</p>



<p>Having thus irresponsibly struck out upon the

canvas her central figure, she would not be slow

to complete the picture with many a rose-colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

vision of brilliant successes and magic triumphs

won by her hero, in his great enterprise of the

redemption of his people. A burning sense of

their wrongs fired his eloquence with an undying,

passionate earnestness, and as he alternately reproached

the injustice, and appealed to the generosity

of his oppressors, all opposition gave way

before him; the masses, as one man, demanded

the emancipation of his long-degraded, deeply

injured race; and millions of regenerated men

rose up, upon their broken chains and called him

blessed.</p>



<p>Years rolled away, and these poetic fancies

faded &#8220;into the light of common day.&#8221; The cold,

stern, pitiless reality remained. The dark incubus

of slavery yet rested down upon more than three

millions of the victims of democratic despotism.

But the triumphant champion of the devoted race

had melted away, with the morning mists of my

boyish conjuring.</p>



<p>One morning in the summer of 1844, walking

up Main-street in the city of Hartford, I was

attracted by the movements of a group of some

twenty-five or thirty men and women, in a small recess,

or court, by the side of the old Centre Church.

They appeared to be organized into an assembly,

and a tall mulatto was addressing them. I drew

near to listen. The speaker was recounting the

oft-enacted history of a flight from slavery. With

his eye upon the cold, but true north star, and his

ear ever and anon bent to the ground, listening for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>

the &#8220;blood-hound&#8217;s savage bay,&#8221; sure-footed and

panting, the fugitive was before me! My attention

had been arrested; I was profoundly interested.

The audience was the American Anti-slavery

Society, then just excluded from some of the

public halls of the city, and fain to content themselves,

after an apostolic sort, with the <i>next best</i>

accommodations. The orator was <span class="smcap">Frederick

Douglass</span>, the most remarkable man of this

country, and of this age; and&mdash;may I not dare

to add&mdash;the almost complete fulfilment of my

early dream!</p>



<p>Since that day, through assiduous application,

and a varied experience, he has continued to

develop in the same wonderful ratio of improvement,

which even then distinguished him as a

prodigy in self-education. Unusually favored in

personal appearance and address, full of generous

impulse and delicate sensibility, exuberant in playful

wit, or biting sarcasm, or stern denunciation,

ever commanding in his moral attitude, earnest

and impressive in manner, with a voice eminently

sonorous and flexible, and gesture full of dramatic

vivacity, I have many times seen large audiences

swayed at his will; at one moment convulsed with

laughter, and at the next, bathed in tears; now

lured with admiration of the orator, and now with

indignation at the oppressor, against whom he

hurled his invective. But in my boyhood&#8217;s quasi-prophetic

fancy of such a man and his inimitable

success, I had not counted upon one antagonist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>

whose reality and potency, the observation of every

day now forces painfully upon me. I mean the

strange and unnatural <i>prejudice against mere color</i>,

which is so all-prevalent in the American breast,

as almost to nullify the influence of <i>such</i> a man,

<i>so</i> pleading; while his dignity, his urbanity, his

imperturbable serenity and good nature, his genuine

purity and worth all fail, at times, to secure him

from the grossest indignities, at the hands of the

coarse and brutal. Nobody who knows him will

be inclined to question our estimate of his character,

but it still comports with the intelligence and

refinement and piety of a large proportion of

American society to label him &#8220;nigger,&#8221; and the

name itself invites to safe contumely, and irresponsible

violence.</p>



<p>I have spoken of Frederick Douglass as an

interesting man&mdash;a wonderful man. Look at

him as he stands to-day before this nation; and

then contemplate his history.</p>



<p>Begin with him when, a little slave-child, he lay

down on his rude pallet, and that slave-mother,

from a plantation twelve miles away, availed herself

of the privilege granted grudgingly, of travelling

the whole distance, after the day&#8217;s work, (on

peril of the lash, unless back again by sunrise to

her task,) that she might lie there by his side, and

sing him with her low sweet song to sleep. &#8220;I do

not recollect,&#8221; says he, &#8220;of ever seeing my mother

by the light of day. She was with me in the

night. She would lie down with me, and get me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>

to sleep, but long before I awaked, she was gone.&#8221;

How touching the love of that dark-browed bondwoman

for her boy! How precious must the memory

of that dim but sweet remembrance be to him,

who though once a vassal, bound and scourged,

and still a Helot, proscribed and wronged, may

not be robbed of this dear token that he, too, <i>had

once a mother</i>! Her low sad lullaby yet warps his

life&#8217;s dark woof&mdash;for she watches over his pathway

now with spirit-eyes, and still keeps singing

on in his heart, and nursing his courage and his

patience.</p>



<p>Follow him through all the tempestuous experience

of his bondage. His lashings, his longings,

his perseverance in possessing himself of the key

of knowledge, which, after all, only unlocked to

him the fatal secret that he was a slave, a thing to

be bought and sold like oxen. Imagine the tumult

of his soul, as standing by the broad Chesapeake,

he watched the receding vessels, &#8220;while they flew

on their white wings before the breeze, and apostrophized

them as animated by the living spirit of

freedom;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> or when reading in a stray copy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>

old &#8220;Columbian Orator,&#8221; (verily, all our school-books

must be expurgated of the incendiary &#8220;perilous

stuff&#8221; in which they abound,) the &#8220;Dialogue

between a Master and his Slave,&#8221; and Sheridan&#8217;s

great speech on Catholic Emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> See to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>

what heroic resistance his proud heart had swollen,

when he turned outright upon his tormentor&mdash;pious

Mr. Corey, the &#8220;nigger-breaker&#8221;&mdash;and inflicted

condign retribution on his heartless ribs;

&#8220;after which,&#8221; says he, significantly, &#8220;I was never

whipped again; <i>I had several fights</i>, but was never

whipped.&#8221; Attend him in his exodus from our

republican Egypt. Witness his struggles with

poverty; his vain attempts to find employment at

his trade, as a colored man, in the <i>free</i> North.

Behold him at last emerging from his obscurity at

the Anti-slavery Convention in Nantucket. Somebody,

who is aware of his extraordinary natural

intelligence, invites him to speak. Tremblingly he

consents. &#8220;As soon as he had taken his seat,&#8221;

said Mr. Garrison, after describing the tremendous

effect of his remarks upon the audience, &#8220;filled

with hope and admiration, I rose and declared that

Patrick Henry, of revolutionary fame, never made

a speech more eloquent in the cause of liberty,

than the one we had just listened to from the

hunted fugitive.&#8221;</p>







<p>That was just <i>eleven years</i> ago,&mdash;and what is

Frederick Douglass now? I would fain avoid the

language of exaggeration. It is ever a cruel

kindness which over-praises, exciting expectations,

which cannot but be disappointed. But when, in

view of the fact that the subject of this sketch was

but thirteen years ago <small>A SLAVE</small>, in all the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>

and disability of Southern bondage, I affirm that

his present character, attainments, and position

constitute a phenomenon hitherto perhaps unprecedented

in the history of intellectual and moral

achievement, none who know and are competent

to weigh the facts, will account the terms extravagant.

It is not to be expected but that his mental

condition should betray his early disadvantages.

His information, though amazing, under the circumstances,

will not of course bear comparison, in

fulness and accuracy, with that of men who have

been accumulating their resources from childhood.

In his writings, the deficiency of early discipline

is most manifest, rendering them diffuse and unequal,

though always interesting, and often exceedingly

effective. He is properly an <i>orator</i>. His

addresses, like those of Whitfield, and many other

popular speakers, lose a large proportion of their

effect in reading. They require the living voice,

and the magnetic presence of the orator. But

even in this respect, Douglass is not uniform in

his performance, but is quite dependent on his

<i>surroundings</i>, and the inspiration of the moment.

But when, all these consenting, he becomes

thoroughly possessed of his theme, and his tall

form&mdash;six feet high and straight as an arrow,&mdash;his

bearing dignified and graceful,&mdash;self-possessed,

yet modest,&mdash;his countenance flexible, and

wonderful in power of expression, and his voice,

with its rich and varied modulation, are all summoned

to the work of enchantment, many a rapt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>

assembly, insignificant in neither numbers nor

intelligence, can testify to the witchery of his eloquence.</p>



<p>And, after all, the <i>moral</i> features of this interesting

character constitute its principal charm. The

integrity and manliness of Frederick Douglass,

potent and acknowledged where he is at all known,

have much to do with his influence as a popular

orator. It has been customary, with a certain

class of Shibboleth-pronouncers to class him with

infidels, but this is only the appropriate and characteristic

retort of a certain sort of &#8220;highly respectable&#8221;

Christianity to his uncompromising denunciations

of its hollow and selfish character. <i>I</i>

think Frederick Douglass is a Christian; he is a

gentleman, I <i>know</i>. There are few white men of

my acquaintance, who could have borne so much

adulation, without losing the balance of their

self-appreciation. Nobody ever knew Frederick

Douglass to over-rate himself, or to thrust himself

anywhere where he did not belong, or upon anybody

who might by any possibility object to his

companionship,&mdash;unless, in the latter case, when

he deemed necessary the assertion of a simple

right. Whence he got his retiring and graceful

modesty, and his nice sense of the minute proprieties,&mdash;unless

it be somehow in his <i>blood</i>,&mdash;is a

mystery to me. Can it be possible that such refinements

are <i>scourged</i> into men &#8220;down South?&#8221;

An illustration of this may be seen in his

response to those gentlemen of Rochester, who, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>

way of gratifying a grudge against the Anti-slavery

faction of their party, nominated Douglass for

Congress in derision.</p>



<blockquote>



<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I have learned with some surprise,

that in the Whig Convention held in this

city on Saturday last, you signified, by your votes,

a desire to make me your representative in the

Legislature of this State. Never having, at any

time that I recollect, thought, spoken, or acted, in

any way, to commit myself to either the principles

or the policy of the Whig party; but on the contrary,

having always held, and publicly expressed

opinions diametrically opposed to those held by

that part of the Whig party which you are supposed

to represent, your voting for me, I am bound

in courtesy to suppose, is founded in a misapprehension

of my political sentiments.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lest you should, at any other time, commit a

similar blunder, I beg to state, once for all, that I

do not believe that the slavery question is settled,

and settled forever. I do not believe that slave-catching

is either a Christian duty, or an innocent

amusement. I do not believe that he who breaks

the arm of the kidnapper, or wrests the trembling

captive from his grasp is &#8216;a traitor.&#8217; I do not

believe that Daniel Webster is the saviour of the

Union, nor that the Union stands in need of such

a saviour. I do not believe that human enactments

are to be obeyed when they are point-blank

against the law of the living God. And believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>

most fully, as I do, the reverse of all this, you

will easily believe me to be a person wholly unfit

to receive the suffrages of gentlemen holding the

opinion and favoring the policy of that wing of

the Whig party denominated &#8216;the <i>Silver Grays</i>.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;With all the respect which your derision permits

me to entertain for you,</p>



<p class="right">

<span class="gapright3">I am, gentlemen,</span><br />



<span class="gapright2">Your faithful fellow-citizen,</span><br />



<span class="smcap">Frederick Douglass</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>The perpetrators of the wanton and gratuitous

insult which elicited this beautiful rebuke, would

be sadly outraged, were we to insist on withholding

the title of &#8220;Gentlemen&#8221; from those who

could, on any pretence, trample on the feelings of

such as they esteem their inferiors. If they half

begin to comprehend the meaning of the term,

much more to feel its power, their cheeks must

have crimsoned with shame, when they saw their

own unprovoked assault, contrasted with the

calm and self-respectful serenity of this reply.</p>



<p>Another instance of this dignity under circumstances

of peculiar trial, may be found in his own

account&mdash;in the columns of &#8220;Frederick Douglass&#8217;

paper&#8221;&mdash;of a rencontre with a hotel clerk in

Cleveland. It is as follows:</p>



<p>At the ringing of the morning bell for breakfast,

I made my way to the table, supposing myself

included in the call; but I was scarcely seated,

when there stepped up to me a young man, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

much agitated, saying: &#8220;Sir, you must

leave this table.&#8221; &#8220;And why,&#8221; said I, &#8220;must I

leave this table?&#8221; &#8220;I want no controversy with

you. You must leave this table.&#8221; I replied,

&#8220;that I had regularly enrolled myself as a boarder

in that house; I expected to pay the same charges

imposed upon others; and I came to the table

in obedience to the call of the bell; and if I left

the table I must know the reason.&#8221; &#8220;We will

serve you in your room. It is against our rules.&#8221;

&#8220;You should have informed me of <i>your rules</i>

earlier. Where are your rules? Let me see

them.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any altercation with you.

You must leave this table.&#8221; &#8220;But have I not

deported myself as a gentleman? What have I

done? Is there any gentleman who objects to my

being seated here?&#8221; (There was silence round

the table.) &#8220;Come, sir, come, sir, you must leave

this table at once.&#8221; &#8220;Well, sir, I cannot leave it

unless you will give me a better reason than you

have done for my removal.&#8221; &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll give you

a reason if you&#8217;ll leave the table and go to another

room.&#8221; &#8220;That, sir, I will not do. You have

invidiously selected me out of all this company,

to be dragged from this table, and have thereby

reflected upon me as a man and a gentleman; and

the reason for this treatment shall be as public as

the insult you have offered.&#8221; At these remarks,

my carrot-headed assailant left me, <i>as he said</i>, to

get help to remove me from the table. Meanwhile

I called upon one of the servants (who appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>

to wait upon me with alacrity) to help me to a

cup of coffee, and assisting myself to some of the

good things before me, I quietly and thankfully

partook of my morning meal without further

annoyance.</p>



<p>Whatever may have been the duty of Mr. Douglass,

(and none who know him can for a moment

doubt what his inclination would have been,) in

case the proscriptive &#8220;rules of the house&#8221; had

been previously made known to him, the justice,

as well as the gentlemanly self-possession of his

bearing, in relation to this public outrage, must, I

think, be sufficiently obvious.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE HEROIC SLAVE-WOMAN.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was my privilege to see much of Edward S.

Abdy, Esq., of England, during his visit to our

country, in 1833 and 1834. The first time I met

him was at the house of Mr. James Forten, of

Philadelphia, in company with two other English

gentlemen, who had come to the United States,

commissioned by the British Parliament to examine

our systems of prison and penitentiary discipline.

Mr. Abdy was interested in whatsoever

affected the welfare of man. But he was more

particularly devoted to the investigation of slavery.

He travelled extensively in our Southern States,

and contemplated with his own eyes the manifold

abominations of our American despotism. He

was too much exasperated by our tyranny to be

enamoured of our democratic institutions; and on

his return to England, he published two very sensible

volumes, that were so little complimentary to

our nation, that our booksellers thought it not

worth their while to republish them.</p>



<p>This warm-hearted philanthropist visited me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

several times at my home in Connecticut. The

last afternoon that he was there, we were sitting

together at my study window, when our attention

was arrested by a very handsome carriage driving

up to the hotel opposite my house. A gentleman

and lady occupied the back seat; and on the front

were two children tended by a black woman, who

wore the turban, that was then more than now,

usually worn by <i>slave</i> women.</p>



<p>We hastened over to the hotel, and soon entered

into conversation with the slave-holder. He

was polite, but somewhat nonchalant, and defiant

of our sympathy with his victim. He readily acknowledged,

as slave-holders of that day generally

did, that, abstractly considered, the enslavement of

fellow men was a great wrong; but then he contended

that it had become a necessary evil, necessary

to the enslaved, no less than to the enslavers;

the former being unable to do without masters, as

much as the latter were to do without servants.

And he added, in a very confident tone, &#8220;you are

at liberty to persuade our servant-woman to remain

here, if you can.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thus challenged, we of course sought an interview

with the slave; and informed her that having

been brought by her master into the free States,

she was, by the laws of the land, set at liberty.

&#8220;No, I am not, gentlemen,&#8221; was her prompt reply.

We adduced cases, and quoted authorities to establish

our assertion that she was free. But she

significantly shook her head, and still insisted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>

the examples and the legal decisions did not reach

her case. &#8220;For,&#8221; said she, &#8220;<i>I promised</i> mistress

that I would go back with her and the children.&#8221;

Mr. Abdy undertook to argue with her that such a

promise was not binding. He had been drilled in

the moral philosophy of Dr. Paley, and in that

debate seemed to be possessed of its spirit. But

he failed to make any visible impression upon the

woman. She had bound herself by a promise to

her mistress, that she would not leave her; and

that promise had fastened upon her conscience an

obligation, from which she could not be persuaded,

that even her natural right to liberty could exonerate

her. Mr. Abdy at last was impatient with

her, and said, in his haste, &#8220;is it possible that you

do not wish to be free?&#8221; She replied with solemn

earnestness, &#8220;was there ever a slave that did not

wish to be free? I long for liberty. I will get out

of slavery, if I can, the day after I have returned,

but go back I must, because I <i>promised</i> that I

would.&#8221; At this, we desisted from our endeavor

to induce her to take the boon that was, apparently

to us, within her reach. We could not but

feel a profound respect for that moral sensibility

which would not allow her to embrace even her

freedom, at the expense of violating a promise.</p>



<p>The next morning, at an early hour, the slave-holder

with his wife and children drove off, leaving

the slave-woman and their heaviest trunk to be

brought on after them in the stage-coach. We

could not refrain from again trying to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>

her to remain and be free. We told her that her

master had given us leave to persuade her if we

could. She pointed to the trunk, and to a very

valuable gold watch and chain, which her mistress

had committed to her care, and insisted that

fidelity to a trust was of more consequence to

her soul even than the attainment of liberty.

Mr. Abdy offered to take the trunk and watch

into his charge, follow her master, and deliver

them into his hands. But she could not be made

to see that in this there would be no violation

of her duty. And then her own person, that, too,

she had promised should be returned to the home

of her master; and much as she longed for liberty,

she longed for a clear conscience more.</p>



<p>Mr. Abdy was astonished, delighted at this instance

of heroice virtue in a poor, ignorant slave.

He packed his trunk, gave me a hearty adieu,

and, when the coach drove up, he took his seat on

the outside with the trunk and the slave&mdash;chattels

of a Mississippi slave-holder&mdash;that he might study

for a few hours more the morality of that strong-hearted

woman, who could not be bribed to violate

her promise, even by the gift of liberty.</p>



<p>It was the last time I saw Mr. Abdy,&mdash;and it

was a sight to be remembered,&mdash;he an accomplished

English gentleman, a Fellow of Oxford or

Cambridge University, riding on the driver&#8217;s box

of a stage-coach, side by side with an American

slave-woman, that he might learn more of her history

and character.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KOSSUTH.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="smcap">You</span> ask me what I think of Kossuth. The

history of Kossuth is but partly told. An opinion

of him now, is, of course, founded on the past and

present. But so decisive have been the manifestations

in regard to his abilities and aims, that we

may confidently say he is the great man of the

age. I don&#8217;t mean that there is no other man

who is responsible for as great or greater physical

and intellectual endowments and education. We

measure men by what they <i>do</i>, not by what they

are <i>able</i> to do. He is great, because he has manifested

great thoughts and corresponding deeds.

In this regard he has no superior.</p>



<p>When I speak of Kossuth as <i>great</i>, I mean that

the divine elements of power, wisdom, and goodness

are so mixed in him, as to qualify him to

embrace the largest interests, and attract the agencies

to secure those interests. That his eye sees,

and his heart feels, and his philanthropy embraces

a larger area, and is acknowledged by a larger portion

of the human family than any other living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

man. I do not say there are not men living whose

hearts are as large, whose abilities are as great,

and whose virtues are as exalted as Kossuth&#8217;s.

Men, too, whose great qualities under like contingencies

would, and by future contingencies may,

brighten into a glory as large as his. Nor would I

say it does not often require as great, or even

greater talents and virtues to accomplish deeds of

humanity or patriotism on a theatre vastly less

dazzling and imposing. It is not necessary to my

argument to exclude such conclusions. When

God decrees great events, he brings upon the

stage and qualifies the human instrumentalities

by which such events are accomplished; and that,

too, at the very time they are needed. We don&#8217;t

know the future; but if we are to measure the

present and the past in the life of Kossuth, leaving

alone the shadows which coming events cast in the

path of our hopes, we must rank Kossuth with the

greatest, and if we couple his heart with his deeds,

with the best of mankind.</p>



<p>I am aware that the opinion I here give of the

great Magyar, is widely different from the opinions

of some others for whom I have very high respect.

Gerrit Smith honors Kossuth; but he honors him

only as a patriot, a christian patriot. Professor

Atler of McGranville College in an oration that

does him credit as a philosopher and orator, says,

that &#8220;he who thinks the largest thought is the

ruler of the world,&#8221;&mdash;and yet he dwarfs the character

of Kossuth to the simple patriot of Hungary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>

To my mind, these are strange conclusions. It is

the greatest thoughts illustrated by corresponding

action that denotes the ruler of the world. It is

the external manifestation of the mighty spiritual

that demonstrates the right to rule mankind.

Apply that rule to Kossuth, and I maintain his

right to the sceptre of the world.</p>



<p>The brotherhood of nations is an idea to which

philanthropy only could give birth. Its home is

in the hearts of all good men, and yet, until

Kossuth came before the world, that idea had

been esteemed so vast in its circumference, so out

of the reach of means, so far beyond the grasp of

present experience and possibility, that he would

have been thought a fanatic or a fool who attempted

it. He, indeed, by power strictly personal, not

only seized upon it as a practical thought, and

nobly argued it, but has actually and bravely entered

upon the experiment, and forced it upon the

conceptions of the world, and organized, not in our

country only, but in Europe, plans and parties for

its realization. Here is not only a great <i>thought</i>,

but a great <i>deed</i>. To gather up the philanthropic

minds or the patriot minds of the world to embrace

such an enterprise as not only a dutiful but

practicable scheme, is an achievement that leaves

out of sight any other achievement of eighteen

hundred years.</p>



<p>It is not the development of abstract principles

in science, in philosophy, or in religion, that establishes

the highest claim to the world&#8217;s gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>

and admiration. It is the successful application

of those principles to human life and conduct, the

setting them to work to restore the world to the

shape and aspect which God gave it, that demonstrates

the God-like in man. It is the manifestation

of a great idea upon the external, as God&#8217;s

great thoughts are manifested by the landscape,

the ocean, and the heavens, by which we arrive at

the spiritual power that conceived them. A patriot

indeed! The great Hungarian <i>did</i> attempt to

link America to his great purpose by appeals to

her patriotism. It was the only common sentiment

between our country and him. It is America&#8217;s

loftiest thought. Her beau-ideal of public virtue.

I don&#8217;t mean that there was no Christianity or

philanthropy in the United States when Kossuth

came amongst us; but I do mean that, as a nation,

we had none of them. He came on an errand of

practical philanthropy; to appeal to our national

heart, and cause the only cord of humanity in it

that could be touched, to vibrate in unison with

his own in behalf of the down-trodden nations of

the world. He wished to engage its organic

power in behalf of national law. Had Kossuth

appealed to any higher principle, he would have

overshot his mark. Love of country is common,

to the Christian and to the mere patriot. In the

latter it is only selfishness, in the former genuine

philanthropy. American patriotism was the only

aperture through which he could reach our nation&#8217;s

heart, to raise it to the higher region of philanthropy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

and place it in his own bosom, and impregnate it

with his own holy sentiments, that their sympathies

might circulate together for a common

brotherhood. He represented Hungary. He

appeared at our door as an outraged brother, to

enlist us in behalf of a brother&#8217;s rights and wrongs.

He sought to excite in the nation&#8217;s bosom the

activity of a common principle, due at all times,

and from nations no less than individuals. It is

the core of Christianity, described in these words,

&#8220;do unto others as you would have others do unto

you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our Washington had told us &#8220;to cultivate peace

with all nations, and form entangling alliances with

none.&#8221; Our sensual and short-sighted statesmen

construed the sentiment as the rule of active power.

Instead of adopting it as Washington probably

intended it, as a rule of temporary policy, they inculcated

the notion that we were to cut ourselves

clear from the family of nations, and live only for

ourselves. The large patriotism of Washington

they had shrunken to the merest selfishness.

We may well thank God for the providence which

sent Kossuth among us, to relieve his fame from

the suspicion of having begot, and our country

from the sin of cherishing, so weak and dishonoring

a delusion. Heaven-assisted man only could have

dreamed of believing a nation so securely blinded.

Like the prophet of God, whose lips were touched

with celestial fire, he breathed upon the spell, and

it vanished. The nation&#8217;s eyes were opened. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>

saw, and all true men admitted, that the sentiment

was designed and adapted only to our infancy,

and, to use his own figure, no more fitting our

manhood, than the clothes of an infant are fitting

the full grown man.</p>



<p>Now I admit we had philanthropists, wise men,

orators, and some statesmen, who asserted the

doctrine of the human brotherhood, yet we had no

Kossuth to dissolve (if I may so speak) this Washingtonian

delusion. Kossuth touched it and it disappeared.

The nation seemed to have come to a

new birth. Its heart, like the rock in the desert

which was touched by the staff of the prophet,

opened, and its imprisoned waters poured over

the world. We all felt as the bondman feels who

is set free by a strong man. From that moment

we grew larger, saw farther, and felt our hearts

moving over an unlimited area of humanity.

From that moment we felt that a new day was

dawning. From that moment the principle of the

human brotherhood struck its deep roots in our

soil, as immovable as our mountains, as irradicable

as our religion. Nor was it in America

alone that this sentiment was then awakened.

Touched by his notes, it trembled in the bosom of

Europe. The heart of humanity throbbed with

a common sympathy throughout the civilized

world. Kossuth and Mazzini, crushed from

beneath, ascended above the despotisms of the

world in the clear upper sky, and, in sight of heaven

and earth, reflected God&#8217;s light and curse upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>

them; and called into being the activities which

we hope is to tumble them in a common ruin, as

the precursor of the holy compact which shall

secure all human rights.</p>



<p>It is objected that Kossuth did not denounce

our slavery. The same objection has equal

strength against the philanthropy of Paul and

Jesus. I shall not dwell on this point. He did

denounce American slavery. The presence of

Kossuth was a killing rebuke, his words a consuming

fire to it. The former is still felt as an

incurable wound, and the latter still scorches to

the very centre of its vitality. I have it from high

authority, when Kossuth first came upon the soil,

and into the atmosphere of American slavery, his

soul was so shocked and disgusted by its offensiveness,

that he proposed to abandon his mission in

those States where it existed, and denounce it specifically;

and was only deterred from doing so, by

his sense of the more comprehensive claims of that

mission, which embraced the utter destruction of

all human oppression. I drop this topic with the

remark, that this objection, and all objections to

his philanthropy, within my knowledge, were

made antecedent to his inimitable speech in New

York city, in behalf of his mother and sisters, a

short time before he took his departure for Europe.

If there is not Christianity, philanthropy, anti-slavery

in that speech, we may despair of finding

it in earth, or even in the heavens. I have never

read anything so representative of heaven&#8217;s mercy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

or angels&#8217; eloquence, as that. Oh! I wish the

world knew it by heart. Methinks if it did, all

wrong and oppression would disappear from

among men.</p>



<p>I was going to speak of the future, and of Mazzini,

the twin apostle of liberty, whose exile was

wrung from the heart of poor Italy. But the subject

exceeds the brevity which must govern me.

These rulers of the world are linked with the

mighty events which are fast becoming history.

From their hiding-places in London, they are

moving and controlling the passions which seem

ready to break forth and obliterate every cruel code

under the sun, and hasten the time when all men

shall feel as brethren, and mingle their hearts in

anthems of gratitude and love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> State of Virginia is famous in American

annals for the multitudinous array of her statesmen

and heroes. She has been dignified by some

the mother of statesmen. History has not been

sparing in recording their names, or in blazoning

their deeds. Her high position in this respect, has

given her an enviable distinction among her sister

States. With Virginia for his birth-place, even a

man of ordinary parts, on account of the general

partiality for her sons, easily rises to eminent stations.

Men, not great enough to attract special

attention in their native States, have, like a certain

distinguished citizen in the State of New York,

sighed and repined that they were not born in

Virginia. Yet not all the great ones of the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>

Dominion have, by the fact of their birth-place,

escaped undeserved obscurity. By some strange

neglect, <i>one</i> of the truest, manliest, and bravest of

her children,&mdash;one who, in after years, will, I think,

command the pen of genius to set his merits forth,

holds now no higher place in the records of that

grand old Commonwealth than is held by a horse

or an ox. Let those account for it who can, but

there stands the fact, that a man who loved liberty

as well as did Patrick Henry,&mdash;who deserved it

as much as Thomas Jefferson,&mdash;and who fought

for it with a valor as high, an arm as strong, and

against odds as great, as he who led all the armies

of the American colonies through the great war

for freedom and independence, lives now only in

the chattel records of his native State.</p>



<p>Glimpses of this great character are all that can

now be presented. He is brought to view only by

a few transient incidents, and these afford but partial

satisfaction. Like a guiding star on a stormy

night, he is seen through the parted clouds and the

howling tempests; or, like the gray peak of a

menacing rock on a perilous coast, he is seen by

the quivering flash of angry lightning, and he again

disappears covered with mystery.</p>



<p>Curiously, earnestly, anxiously we peer into the

dark, and wish even for the blinding flash, or the

light of northern skies to reveal him. But alas! he

is still enveloped in darkness, and we return from the

pursuit like a wearied and disheartened mother,

(after a tedious and unsuccessful search for a lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>

child,) who returns weighed down with disappointment

and sorrow. Speaking of marks, traces,

possibles, and probabilities, we come before our

readers.</p>



<hr class="tb" />



<p>In the spring of 1835, on a Sabbath morning,

within hearing of the solemn peals of the church

bells at a distant village, a Northern traveller

through the State of Virginia drew up his horse to

drink at a sparkling brook, near the edge of a dark

pine forest. While his weary and thirsty steed

drew in the grateful water, the rider caught the

sound of a human voice, apparently engaged in

earnest conversation.</p>



<p>Following the direction of the sound, he descried,

among the tall pines, the man whose voice had

arrested his attention. &#8220;To whom can he be

speaking?&#8221; thought the traveller. &#8220;He seems to

be alone.&#8221; The circumstance interested him much,

and he became intensely curious to know what

thoughts and feelings, or, it might be, high aspirations,

guided those rich and mellow accents. Tieing

his horse at a short distance from the brook,

he stealthily drew near the solitary speaker; and,

concealing himself by the side of a huge fallen

tree, he distinctly heard the following soliloquy:&mdash;</p>







<p>&#8220;What, then, is life to me? it is aimless and

worthless, and worse than worthless. Those

birds, perched on yon swinging boughs, in friendly

conclave, sounding forth their merry notes in

seeming worship of the rising sun, though liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>

to the sportsman&#8217;s fowling-piece, are still my superiors.

They <i>live free</i>, though they may die

slaves. They fly where they list by day, and

retire in freedom at night. But what is freedom

to me, or I to it? I am a <i>slave</i>,&mdash;born a slave,

an abject slave,&mdash;even before I made part of

this breathing world, the scourge was platted for

my back; the fetters were forged for my limbs.

How mean a thing am I. That accursed and

crawling snake, that miserable reptile, that has

just glided into its slimy home, is freer and better

off than I. He escaped my blow, and is safe. But

here am I, a man,&mdash;yes, <i>a man!</i>&mdash;with thoughts

and wishes, with powers and faculties as far as

angel&#8217;s flight above that hated reptile,&mdash;yet he is

my superior, and scorns to own me as his master,

or to stop to take my blows. When he saw my

uplifted arm, he darted beyond my reach, and

turned to give me battle. I dare not do as much

as that. I neither run nor fight, but do meanly

stand, answering each heavy blow of a cruel master

with doleful wails and piteous cries. I am galled

with irons; but even these are more tolerable than

the consciousness, the <i>galling</i> consciousness of

cowardice and indecision. Can it be that I <i>dare</i>

not run away? <i>Perish the thought</i>, I <i>dare</i> do any

thing which may be done by another. When that

young man struggled with the waves <i>for life</i>, and

others stood back appalled in helpless horror, did I

not plunge in, forgetful of life, to save his? The

raging bull from whom all others fled, pale with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>

fright, did I not keep at bay with a single pitch-fork?

Could a coward do that? <i>No</i>,&mdash;<i>no</i>,&mdash;I

wrong myself,&mdash;I am no coward. <i>Liberty</i> I will

have, or die in the attempt to gain it. This working

that others may live in idleness! This cringing

submission to insolence and curses! This living

under the constant dread and apprehension of

being sold and transferred, like a mere brute, is <i>too</i>

much for me. I will stand it no longer. What

others have done, I will do. These trusty legs, or

these sinewy arms shall place me among the free.

Tom escaped; so can I. The North Star will not

be less kind to me than to him. I will follow it.

I will at least make the trial. I have nothing to

lose. If I am caught, I shall only be a slave. If I

am shot, I shall only lose a life which is a burden

and a curse. If I get clear, (as something tells me

I shall,) liberty, the inalienable birth-right of every

man, precious and priceless, will be mine. My

resolution is fixed. <i>I shall be free.</i>&#8221;</p>



<p>At these words the traveller raised his head

cautiously and noiselessly, and caught, from his

hiding-place, a full view of the unsuspecting speaker.

Madison (for that was the name of our hero)

was standing erect, a smile of satisfaction rippled

upon his expressive countenance, like that which

plays upon the face of one who has but just solved

a difficult problem, or vanquished a malignant foe;

for at that moment he was free, at least in spirit.

The future gleamed brightly before him, and his

fetters lay broken at his feet. His air was triumphant.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>Madison was of manly form. Tall, symmetrical,

round, and strong. In his movements he seemed

to combine, with the strength of the lion, a lion&#8217;s

elasticity. His torn sleeves disclosed arms like

polished iron. His face was &#8220;black, but comely.&#8221;

His eye, lit with emotion, kept guard under a brow

as dark and as glossy as the raven&#8217;s wing. His

whole appearance betokened Herculean strength;

yet there was nothing savage or forbidding in his

aspect. A child might play in his arms, or dance

on his shoulders. A giant&#8217;s strength, but not a

giant&#8217;s heart was in him. His broad mouth and

nose spoke only of good mature and kindness.

But his voice, that unfailing index of the soul,

though full and melodious, had that in it which

could terrify as well as charm. He was just the

man you would choose when hardships were to

be endured, or danger to be encountered,&mdash;intelligent

and brave. He had the head to conceive,

and the hand to execute. In a word, he was one

to be sought as a friend, but to be dreaded as an

enemy.</p>



<p>As our traveller gazed upon him, he almost

trembled at the thought of his dangerous intrusion.

Still he could not quit the place. He had long

desired to sound the mysterious depths of the

thoughts and feelings of a slave. He was not,

therefore, disposed to allow so providential an opportunity

to pass unimproved. He resolved to

hear more; so he listened again for those mellow

and mournful accents which, he says, made such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>

impression upon him as can never be erased. He

did not have to wait long. There came another

gush from the same full fountain; now bitter, and

now sweet. Scathing denunciations of the cruelty

and injustice of slavery; heart-touching narrations

of his own personal suffering, intermingled

with prayers to the God of the oppressed for help

and deliverance, were followed by presentations

of the dangers and difficulties of escape, and

formed the burden of his eloquent utterances; but

his high resolution clung to him,&mdash;for he ended

each speech by an emphatic declaration of his purpose

to be free. It seemed that the very repetition

of this, imparted a glow to his countenance. The

hope of freedom seemed to sweeten, for a season,

the bitter cup of slavery, and to make it, for a

time, tolerable; for when in the very whirlwind

of anguish,&mdash;when his heart&#8217;s cord seemed screwed

up to snapping tension, hope sprung up and

soothed his troubled spirit. Fitfully he would

exclaim, &#8220;How can I leave her? Poor thing!

what can she do when I am gone? Oh! oh! &#8217;tis

impossible that I can leave poor Susan!&#8221;</p>



<p>A brief pause intervened. Our traveller raised

his head, and saw again the sorrow-smitten slave.

His eye was fixed upon the ground. The strong

man staggered under a heavy load. Recovering

himself, he argued thus aloud: &#8220;All is uncertain

here. To-morrow&#8217;s sun may not rise before I am

sold, and separated from her I love. What, then,

could I do for her? I should be in more hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

slavery, and she no nearer to liberty,&mdash;whereas

if I were free,&mdash;my arms my own,&mdash;I might

devise the means to rescue her.&#8221;</p>



<p>This said, Madison cast around a searching

glance, as if the thought of being overheard had

flashed across his mind. He said no more, but,

with measured steps, walked away, and was lost

to the eye of our traveller amidst the wildering

woods.</p>



<p>Long after Madison had left the ground, Mr.

Listwell (our traveller) remained in motionless

silence, meditating on the extraordinary revelations

to which he had listened. He seemed fastened

to the spot, and stood half hoping, half fearing

the return of the sable preacher to his solitary

temple. The speech of Madison rung through

the chambers of his soul, and vibrated through his

entire frame. &#8220;Here is indeed a man,&#8221; thought

he, &#8220;of rare endowments,&mdash;a child of God,&mdash;guilty

of no crime but the color of his skin,&mdash;hiding

away from the face of humanity, and

pouring out his thoughts and feelings, his hopes

and resolutions to the lonely woods; to him those

distant church bells have no grateful music. He

shuns the church, the altar, and the great congregation

of christian worshippers, and wanders

away to the gloomy forest, to utter in the vacant

air complaints and griefs, which the religion of his

times and his country can neither console nor

relieve. Goaded almost to madness by the sense

of the injustice done him, he resorts hither to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>

vent to his pent up feelings, and to debate with

himself the feasibility of plans, plans of his own

invention, for his own deliverance. From this hour

I am an abolitionist. I have seen enough and heard

enough, and I shall go to my home in Ohio resolved

to atone for my past indifference to this ill-starred

race, by making such exertions as I shall

be able to do, for the speedy emancipation of every

slave in the land.&#8221;</p>

<div class="verseright"><i>Shakspeare.</i></div>

</div></div></div>



<p>Five years after the foregoing singular occurrence,

in the winter of 1840, Mr. and Mrs. Listwell

sat together by the fireside of their own happy home,

in the State of Ohio. The children were all gone

to bed. A single lamp burnt brightly on the centre-table.

All was still and comfortable within; but

the night was cold and dark; a heavy wind sighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>

and moaned sorrowfully around the house and

barn, occasionally bringing against the clattering

windows a stray leaf from the large oak trees that

embowered their dwelling. It was a night for

strange noises and for strange fancies. A whole

wilderness of thought might pass through one&#8217;s

mind during such an evening. The smouldering

embers, partaking of the spirit of the restless night,

became fruitful of varied and fantastic pictures,

and revived many bygone scenes and old impressions.

The happy pair seemed to sit in silent

fascination, gazing on the fire. Suddenly this

<i>reverie</i> was interrupted by a heavy growl. Ordinarily

such an occurrence would have scarcely

provoked a single word, or excited the least apprehension.

But there are certain seasons when the

slightest sound sends a jar through all the subtle

chambers of the mind; and such a season was this.

The happy pair started up, as if some sudden

danger had come upon them. The growl was

from their trusty watch-dog.</p>



<p>&#8220;What can it mean? certainly no one can be

out on such a night as this,&#8221; said Mrs. Listwell.</p>



<p>&#8220;The wind has deceived the dog, my dear; he

has mistaken the noise of falling branches, brought

down by the wind, for that of the footsteps of persons

coming to the house. I have several times

to-night thought that I heard the sound of footsteps.

I am sure, however, that it was but the

wind. Friends would not be likely to come out

at such an hour, or such a night; and thieves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>

too lazy and self-indulgent to expose themselves to

this biting frost; but should there be any one

about, our brave old Monte, who is on the look-out,

will not be slow in sounding the alarm.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying this they quietly left the window, whither

they had gone to learn the cause of the menacing

growl, and re-seated themselves by the fire, as if

reluctant to leave the slowly expiring embers,

although the hour was late. A few minutes only

intervened after resuming their seats, when again

their sober meditations were disturbed. Their

faithful dog now growled and barked furiously,

as if assailed by an advancing foe. Simultaneously

the good couple arose, and stood in mute expectation.

The contest without seemed fierce and

violent. It was, however, soon over,&mdash;the barking

ceased, for, with true canine instinct, Monte

quickly discovered that a friend, not an enemy

of the family, was coming to the house, and instead

of rushing to repel the supposed intruder, he

was now at the door, whimpering and dancing

for the admission of himself and his newly made

friend.</p>



<p>Mr. Listwell knew by this movement that all

was well; he advanced and opened the door,

and saw by the light that streamed out into the

darkness, a tall man advancing slowly towards the

house, with a stick in one hand, and a small

bundle in the other. &#8220;It is a traveller,&#8221; thought

he, &#8220;who has missed his way, and is coming to

inquire the road. I am glad we did not go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>

bed earlier,&mdash;I have felt all the evening as if

somebody would be here to-night.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man had now halted a short distance from

the door, and looked prepared alike for flight or

battle. &#8220;Come in, sir, don&#8217;t be alarmed, you have

probably lost your way.&#8221;</p>



<p>Slightly hesitating, the traveller walked in; not,

however, without regarding his host with a scrutinizing

glance. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have come to

ask you a greater favor.&#8221;</p>



<p>Instantly Mr. Listwell exclaimed, (as the recollection

of the Virginia forest scene flashed upon

him,) &#8220;Oh, sir, I know not your name, but I have

seen your face, and heard your voice before. I

am glad to see you. <i>I know all.</i> You are flying

for your liberty,&mdash;be seated,&mdash;be seated,&mdash;banish

all fear. You are safe under my roof.&#8221;</p>



<p>This recognition, so unexpected, rather disconcerted

and disquieted the noble fugitive. The

timidity and suspicion of persons escaping from

slavery are easily awakened, and often what is

intended to dispel the one, and to allay the other,

has precisely the opposite effect. It was so in

this case. Quickly observing the unhappy impression

made by his words and action, Mr. Listwell

assumed a more quiet and inquiring aspect, and

finally succeeded in removing the apprehensions

which his very natural and generous salutation

had aroused.</p>



<p>Thus assured, the stranger said, &#8220;Sir, you have

rightly guessed, I am, indeed, a fugitive from slavery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>

My name is Madison,&mdash;Madison Washington

my mother used to call me. I am on my

way to Canada, where I learn that persons of

my color are protected in all the rights of men;

and my object in calling upon you was, to beg

the privilege of resting my weary limbs for the

night in your barn. It was my purpose to have

continued my journey till morning; but the piercing

cold, and the frowning darkness compelled me

to seek shelter; and, seeing a light through the

lattice of your window, I was encouraged to come

here to beg the privilege named. You will do me

a great favor by affording me shelter for the

night.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A resting-place, indeed, sir, you shall have;

not, however, in my barn, but in the best room of

my house. Consider yourself, if you please, under

the roof of a friend; for such I am to you, and to

all your deeply injured race.&#8221;</p>



<p>While this introductory conversation was going

on, the kind lady had revived the fire, and was

diligently preparing supper; for she, not less than

her husband, felt for the sorrows of the oppressed

and hunted ones of earth, and was always glad

of an opportunity to do them a service. A bountiful

repast was quickly prepared, and the hungry

and toil-worn bondman was cordially invited to

partake thereof. Gratefully he acknowledged the

favor of his benevolent benefactress; but appeared

scarcely to understand what such hospitality could

mean. It was the first time in his life that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>

met so humane and friendly a greeting at the

hands of persons whose color was unlike his own;

yet it was impossible for him to doubt the charitableness

of his new friends, or the genuineness of

the welcome so freely given; and he therefore, with

many thanks, took his seat at the table with Mr.

and Mrs. Listwell, who, desirous to make him feel

at home, took a cup of tea themselves, while urging

upon Madison the best that the house could

afford.</p>



<p>Supper over, all doubts and apprehensions banished,

the three drew around the blazing fire, and

a conversation commenced which lasted till long

after midnight.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Madison to Mr. Listwell, &#8220;I was

a little surprised and alarmed when I came in, by

what you said; do tell me, sir, <i>why</i> you thought

you had seen my face before, and by what you

knew me to be a fugitive from slavery; for I am

sure that I never was before in this neighborhood,

and I certainly sought to conceal what I supposed

to be the manner of a fugitive slave.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr. Listwell at once frankly disclosed the secret;

describing the place where he first saw him; rehearsing

the language which he (Madison) had

used; referring to the effect which his manner and

speech had made upon him; declaring the resolution

he there formed to be an abolitionist; telling how

often he had spoken of the circumstance, and the

deep concern he had ever since felt to know what

had become of him; and whether he had carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>

out the purpose to make his escape, as in the

woods he declared he would do.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ever since that morning,&#8221; said Mr. Listwell,

&#8220;you have seldom been absent from my mind, and

though now I did not dare to hope that I should

ever see you again, I have often wished that such

might be my fortune; for, from that hour, your

face seemed to be daguerreotyped on my memory.&#8221;</p>



<p>Madison looked quite astonished, and felt

amazed at the narration to which he had listened.

After recovering himself he said, &#8220;I well remember

that morning, and the bitter anguish that

wrung my heart; I will state the occasion of it.

I had, on the previous Saturday, suffered a cruel

lashing; had been tied up to the limb of a tree,

with my feet chained together, and a heavy iron

bar placed between my ankles. Thus suspended,

I received on my naked back forty stripes, and

was kept in this distressing position three or four

hours, and was then let down, only to have my

torture increased; for my bleeding back, gashed by

the cow-skin, was washed by the overseer with old

brine, partly to augment my suffering, and partly,

as he said, to prevent inflammation. My crime

was that I had stayed longer at the mill, the day

previous, than it was thought I ought to have

done, which, I assured my master and the overseer,

was no fault of mine; but no excuses were allowed.

&#8216;Hold your tongue, you impudent rascal,&#8217;

met my every explanation. Slave-holders are so

imperious when their passions are excited, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

construe every word of the slave into insolence.

I could do nothing but submit to the agonizing

infliction. Smarting still from the wounds, as well

as from the consciousness of being whipt for no

cause, I took advantage of the absence of my

master, who had gone to church, to spend the time

in the woods, and brood over my wretched lot.

Oh, sir, I remember it well,&mdash;and can never forget

it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But this was five years ago; where have you

been since?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I will try to tell you,&#8221; said Madison. &#8220;Just

four weeks after that Sabbath morning, I gathered

up the few rags of clothing I had, and started, as

I supposed, for the North and for freedom. I

must not stop to describe my feelings on taking

this step. It seemed like taking a leap into the

dark. The thought of leaving my poor wife and

two little children caused me indescribable anguish;

but consoling myself with the reflection that once

free, I could, possibly, devise ways and means to

gain their freedom also, I nerved myself up to

make the attempt. I started, but ill-luck attended

me; for after being out a whole week, strange to

say, I still found myself on my master&#8217;s grounds;

the third night after being out, a season of clouds

and rain set in, wholly preventing me from seeing

the North Star, which I had trusted as my guide,

not dreaming that clouds might intervene between

us.</p>



<p>&#8220;This circumstance was fatal to my project, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>

in losing my star, I lost my way; so when I supposed

I was far towards the North, and had

almost gained my freedom, I discovered myself at

the very point from which I had started. It was

a severe trial, for I arrived at home in great destitution;

my feet were sore, and in travelling in the

dark, I had dashed my foot against a stump, and

started a nail, and lamed myself. I was wet and

cold; one week had exhausted all my stores; and

when I landed on my master&#8217;s plantation, with all

my work to do over again,&mdash;hungry, tired, lame, and

bewildered,&mdash;I almost cursed the day that I was

born. In this extremity I approached the quarters.

I did so stealthily, although in my desperation I

hardly cared whether I was discovered or not.

Peeping through the rents of the quarters, I saw

my fellow-slaves seated by a warm fire, merrily

passing away the time, as though their hearts knew

no sorrow. Although I envied their seeming contentment,

all wretched as I was, I despised the

cowardly acquiescence in their own degradation

which it implied, and felt a kind of pride and

glory in my own desperate lot. I dared not enter

the quarters,&mdash;for where there is seeming contentment

with slavery, there is certain treachery to

freedom. I proceeded towards the great house, in

the hope of catching a glimpse of my poor wife,

whom I knew might be trusted with my secrets

even on the scaffold. Just as I reached the fence

which divided the field from the garden, I saw a

woman in the yard, who in the darkness I took to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

be my wife; but a nearer approach told me it was

not she. I was about to speak; had I done so, I

would not have been here this night; for an alarm

would have been sounded, and the hunters been

put on my track. Here were hunger, cold, thirst,

disappointment, and chagrin, confronted only by

the dim hope of liberty. I tremble to think of that

dreadful hour. To face the deadly cannon&#8217;s mouth

in warm blood unterrified, is, I think, a small

achievement, compared with a conflict like this

with gaunt starvation. The gnawings of hunger

conquers by degrees, till all that a man has he

would give in exchange for a single crust of bread.

Thank God, I was not quite reduced to this extremity.</p>



<p>&#8220;Happily for me, before the fatal moment of utter

despair, my good wife made her appearance in the

yard. It was she; I knew her step. All was well

now. I was, however, afraid to speak, lest I should

frighten her. Yet speak I did; and, to my great

joy, my voice was known. Our meeting can be

more easily imagined than described. For a time

hunger, thirst, weariness, and lameness were forgotten.

But it was soon necessary for her to return

to the house. She being a house-servant, her

absence from the kitchen, if discovered, might have

excited suspicion. Our parting was like tearing

the flesh from my bones; yet it was the part of

wisdom for her to go. She left me with the purpose

of meeting me at midnight in the very forest

where you last saw me. She knew the place well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>

as one of my melancholy resorts, and could easily

find it, though the night was dark.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hastened away, therefore, and concealed

myself, to await the arrival of my good angel. As

I lay there among the leaves, I was strongly tempted

to return again to the house of my master and

give myself up; but remembering my solemn

pledge on that memorable Sunday morning, I

was able to linger out the two long hours between

ten and midnight. I may well call them long

hours. I have endured much hardship; I have

encountered many perils; but the anxiety of those

two hours, was the bitterest I ever experienced.

True to her word, my wife came laden with provisions,

and we sat down on the side of a log, at

that dark and lonesome hour of the night. I cannot

say we talked; our feelings were too great for

that; yet we came to an understanding that I

should make the woods my home, for if I gave

myself up, I should be whipped and sold away;

and if I started for the North, I should leave a

wife doubly dear to me. We mutually determined,

therefore, that I should remain in the

vicinity. In the dismal swamps I lived, sir, five

long years,&mdash;a cave for my home during the day.

I wandered about at night with the wolf and the

bear,&mdash;sustained by the promise that my good

Susan would meet me in the pine woods at least

once a week. This promise was redeemed, I

assure you, to the letter, greatly to my relief. I

had partly become contented with my mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>

life, and had made up my mind to spend my days

there; but the wilderness that sheltered me thus

long took fire, and refused longer to be my hiding-place.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will not harrow up your feelings by portraying

the terrific scene of this awful conflagration.

There is nothing to which I can liken it. It was

horribly and indescribably grand. The whole

world seemed on fire, and it appeared to me that

the day of judgment had come; that the burning

bowels of the earth had burst forth, and that the

end of all things was at hand. Bears and wolves,

scorched from their mysterious hiding-places in

the earth, and all the wild inhabitants of the untrodden

forest, filled with a common dismay, ran forth,

yelling, howling, bewildered amidst the smoke and

flame. The very heavens seemed to rain down

fire through the towering trees; it was by the

merest chance that I escaped the devouring element.

Running before it, and stopping occasionally

to take breath, I looked back to behold its

frightful ravages, and to drink in its savage magnificence.

It was awful, thrilling, solemn, beyond

compare. When aided by the fitful wind, the

merciless tempest of fire swept on, sparkling, creaking,

cracking, curling, roaring, out-doing in its

dreadful splendor a thousand thunderstorms at

once. From tree to tree it leaped, swallowing

them up in its lurid, baleful glare; and leaving them

leafless, limbless, charred, and lifeless behind. The

scene was overwhelming, stunning,&mdash;nothing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>

spared,&mdash;cattle, tame and wild, herds of swine and

of deer, wild beasts of every name and kind,&mdash;huge

night-birds, bats, and owls, that had retired to their

homes in lofty tree-tops to rest, perished in that

fiery storm. The long-winged buzzard and croaking

raven mingled their dismal cries with those of

the countless myriads of small birds that rose up

to the skies, and were lost to the sight in clouds

of smoke and flame. Oh, I shudder when I think

of it! Many a poor wandering fugitive, who, like

myself, had sought among wild beasts the mercy

denied by our fellow men, saw, in helpless consternation,

his dwelling-place and city of refuge

reduced to ashes forever. It was this grand conflagration

that drove me hither; I ran alike from

fire and from slavery.&#8221;</p>



<p>After a slight pause, (for both speaker and

hearers were deeply moved by the above recital,)

Mr. Listwell, addressing Madison, said, &#8220;If it

does not weary you too much, do tell us something

of your journeyings since this disastrous

burning,&mdash;we are deeply interested in everything

which can throw light on the hardships of persons

escaping from slavery; we could hear you talk all

night; are there no incidents that you could relate

of your travels hither? or are they such that you

do not like to mention them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For the most part, sir, my course has been

uninterrupted; and, considering the circumstances,

at times even pleasant. I have suffered little for

want of food; but I need not tell you how I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>

it. Your moral code may differ from mine, as

your customs and usages are different. The fact

is, sir, during my flight, I felt myself robbed by

society of all my just rights; that I was in an

enemy&#8217;s land, who sought both my life and my

liberty. They had transformed me into a brute;

made merchandise of my body, and, for all the purposes

of my flight, turned day into night,&mdash;and

guided by my own necessities, and in contempt of

their conventionalities, I did not scruple to take

bread where I could get it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And just there you were right,&#8221; said Mr. Listwell;

&#8220;I once had doubts on this point myself,

but a conversation with Gerrit Smith, (a man, by

the way, that I wish you could see, for he is a

devoted friend of your race, and I know he would

receive you gladly,) put an end to all my doubts

on this point. But do not let me interrupt you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had but one narrow escape during my whole

journey,&#8221; said Madison.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do let us hear of it,&#8221; said Mr. Listwell.</p>



<p>&#8220;Two weeks ago,&#8221; continued Madison, &#8220;after

travelling all night, I was overtaken by daybreak,

in what seemed to me an almost interminable

wood. I deemed it unsafe to go farther, and, as

usual, I looked around for a suitable tree in which

to spend the day. I liked one with a bushy top,

and found one just to my mind. Up I climbed,

and hiding myself as well as I could, I, with

this strap, (pulling one out of his old coat-pocket,)

lashed myself to a bough, and flattered myself that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>

I should get a <i>good night&#8217;s</i> sleep that day; but in

this I was soon disappointed. I had scarcely got

fastened to my natural hammock, when I heard

the voices of a number of persons, apparently

approaching the part of the woods where I was.

Upon my word, sir, I dreaded more these human

voices than I should have done those of wild

beasts. I was at a loss to know what to do. If

I descended, I should probably be discovered by

the men; and if they had dogs I should, doubtless,

be &#8216;<i>treed</i>.&#8217; It was an anxious moment, but

hardships and dangers have been the accompaniments

of my life; and have, perhaps, imparted to

me a certain hardness of character, which, to some

extent, adapts me to them. In my present predicament,

I decided to hold my place in the tree-top,

and abide the consequences. But here I must

disappoint you; for the men, who were all colored,

halted at least a hundred yards from me, and

began with their axes, in right good earnest, to

attack the trees. The sound of their laughing

axes was like the report of as many well-charged

pistols. By and by there came down at least a

dozen trees with a terrible crash. They leaped

upon the fallen trees with an air of victory. I

could see no dog with them, and felt myself comparatively

safe, though I could not forget the possibility

that some freak or fancy might bring the

axe a little nearer my dwelling than comported

with my safety.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was no sleep for me that day, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>

wished for night. You may imagine that the

thought of having the tree attacked under me was

far from agreeable, and that it very easily kept me

on the look-out. The day was not without diversion.

The men at work seemed to be a gay set;

and they would often make the woods resound

with that uncontrolled laughter for which we, as a

race, are remarkable. I held my place in the tree

till sunset,&mdash;saw the men put on their jackets to

be off. I observed that all left the ground except

one, whom I saw sitting on the side of a stump,

with his head bowed, and his eyes apparently fixed

on the ground. I became interested in him. After

sitting in the position to which I have alluded ten

or fifteen minutes, he left the stump, walked

directly towards the tree in which I was secreted,

and halted almost under the same. He stood for

a moment and looked around, deliberately and

reverently took off his hat, by which I saw that he

was a man in the evening of life, slightly bald and

quite gray. After laying down his hat carefully,

he knelt and prayed aloud, and such a prayer, the

most fervent, earnest, and solemn, to which I think

I ever listened. After reverently addressing the

Almighty, as the all-wise, all-good, and the common

Father of all mankind, he besought God for

grace, for strength, to bear up under, and to endure,

as a good soldier, all the hardships and trials which

beset the journey of life, and to enable him to live

in a manner which accorded with the gospel of

Christ. His soul now broke out in humble supplication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>

for deliverance from bondage. &#8216;O thou,&#8217;

said he, &#8216;that hearest the raven&#8217;s cry, take pity

on poor me! O deliver me! O deliver me! in

mercy, O God, deliver me from the chains and

manifold hardships of slavery! With thee, O

Father, all things are possible. Thou canst stand

and measure the earth. Thou hast beheld and

drove asunder the nations,&mdash;all power is in thy

hand,&mdash;thou didst say of old, &#8220;I have seen the

affliction of my people, and am come to deliver

them,&#8221;&mdash;Oh look down upon our afflictions, and

have mercy upon us.&#8217; But I cannot repeat his

prayer, nor can I give you an idea of its deep

pathos. I had given but little attention to religion,

and had but little faith in it; yet, as the old man

prayed, I felt almost like coming down and kneel by

his side, and mingle my broken complaint with his.</p>



<p>&#8220;He had already gained my confidence; as how

could it be otherwise? I knew enough of religion

to know that the man who prays in secret is far

more likely to be sincere than he who loves to pray

standing in the street, or in the great congregation.

When he arose from his knees, like another Zacheus,

I came down from the tree. He seemed a little

alarmed at first, but I told him my story, and the

good man embraced me in his arms, and assured

me of his sympathy.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was now about out of provisions, and thought

I might safely ask him to help me replenish my

store. He said he had no money; but if he had,

he would freely give it me. I told him I had <i>one

dollar</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> it was all the money I had in the world.

I gave it to him, and asked him to purchase some

crackers and cheese, and to kindly bring me the

balance; that I would remain in or near that place,

and would come to him on his return, if he would

whistle. He was gone only about an hour. Meanwhile,

from some cause or other, I know not what,

(but as you shall see very wisely,) I changed my

place. On his return I started to meet him; but

it seemed as if the shadow of approaching danger

fell upon my spirit, and checked my progress. In

a very few minutes, closely on the heels of the old

man, I distinctly saw <i>fourteen men</i>, with something

like guns in their hands.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh! the old wretch!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Listwell,

&#8220;he had betrayed you, had he?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Madison, &#8220;I cannot believe

that the old man was to blame. He probably

went into a store, asked for the articles for which

I sent, and presented the bill I gave him; and it is

so unusual for slaves in the country to have money,

that fact, doubtless, excited suspicion, and gave

rise to inquiry. I can easily believe that the truthfulness

of the old man&#8217;s character compelled him

to disclose the facts; and thus were these blood-thirsty

men put on my track. Of course I did

not present myself; but hugged my hiding-place

securely. If discovered and attacked, I resolved

to sell my life as dearly as possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;After searching about the woods silently for a

time, the whole company gathered around the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>

man; one charged him with lying, and called him

an old villain; said he was a thief; charged him

with stealing money; said if he did not instantly

tell where he got it, they would take the shirt from

his old back, and give him thirty-nine lashes.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;I did <i>not</i> steal the money,&#8217; said the old man,

&#8216;it was given me, as I told you at the store; and

if the man who gave it me is not here, it is not

my fault.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hush! you lying old rascal; we&#8217;ll make you

smart for it. You shall not leave this spot until

you have told where you got that money.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;They now took hold of him, and began to strip

him; while others went to get sticks with which

to beat him. I felt, at the moment, like rushing out

in the midst of them; but considering that the old

man would be whipped the more for having aided

a fugitive slave, and that, perhaps, in the <i>mel�e</i> he

might be killed outright, I disobeyed this impulse.

They tied him to a tree, and began to whip him.

My own flesh crept at every blow, and I seem to

hear the old man&#8217;s piteous cries even now. They

laid thirty-nine lashes on his bare back, and were

going to repeat that number, when one of the company

besought his comrades to desist. &#8216;You&#8217;ll

kill the d&mdash;d old scoundrel! You&#8217;ve already whipt

a dollar&#8217;s worth out of him, even if he stole it!&#8217;

&#8216;O yes,&#8217; said another, &#8216;let him down. He&#8217;ll never

tell us another lie, I&#8217;ll warrant ye!&#8217; With this,

one of the company untied the old man, and bid

him go about his business.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>The old man left, but the company remained as

much as an hour, scouring the woods. Round and

round they went, turning up the underbrush, and

peering about like so many bloodhounds. Two

or three times they came within six feet of where

I lay. I tell you I held my stick with a firmer

grasp than I did in coming up to your house to-night.

I expected to level one of them at least.

Fortunately, however, I eluded their pursuit, and

they left me alone in the woods.</p>



<p>&#8220;My last dollar was now gone, and you may

well suppose I felt the loss of it; but the thought

of being once again free to pursue my journey,

prevented that depression which a sense of destitution

causes; so swinging my little bundle on my

back, I caught a glimpse of the <i>Great Bear</i> (which

ever points the way to my beloved star,) and I

started again on my journey. What I lost in money

I made up at a hen-roost that same night, upon

which I fortunately came.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t eat your food raw? How did

you cook it?&#8221; said Mrs. Listwell.</p>



<p>&#8220;O no, Madam,&#8221; said Madison, turning to his

little bundle;&mdash;&#8220;I had the means of cooking.&#8221;

Here he took out of his bundle an old-fashioned

tinder-box, and taking up a piece of a file, which

he brought with him, he struck it with a heavy

flint, and brought out at least a dozen sparks at

once. &#8220;I have had this old box,&#8221; said he, &#8220;more

than five years. It is the <i>only</i> property saved from

the fire in the dismal swamp. It has done me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>

good service. It has given me the means of

broiling many a chicken!&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed quite a relief to Mrs. Listwell to know

that Madison had, at least, lived upon cooked food.

Women have a perfect horror of eating uncooked

food.</p>



<p>By this time thoughts of what was best to be

done about getting Madison to Canada, began to

trouble Mr. Listwell; for the laws of Ohio were

very stringent against any one who should aid, or

who were found aiding a slave to escape through

that State. A citizen, for the simple act of taking

a fugitive slave in his carriage, had just been stripped

of all his property, and thrown penniless upon

the world. Notwithstanding this, Mr. Listwell

was determined to see Madison safely on his way

to Canada. &#8220;Give yourself no uneasiness,&#8221; said

he to Madison, &#8220;for if it cost my farm, I shall see

you safely out of the States, and on your way to a

land of liberty. Thank God that there is <i>such</i> a

land so near us! You will spend to-morrow with

us, and to-morrow night I will take you in my

carriage to the Lake. Once upon that, and you

are safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you! thank you,&#8221; said the fugitive; &#8220;I

will commit myself to your care.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the <i>first</i> time during <i>five</i> years, Madison

enjoyed the luxury of resting his limbs on a comfortable

bed, and inside a human habitation.

Looking at the white sheets, he said to Mr. Listwell,

&#8220;What, sir! you don&#8217;t mean that I shall

sleep in that bed?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>&#8220;Oh yes, oh yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>After Mr. Listwell left the room, Madison said

he really hesitated whether or not he should lie

on the floor; for that was <i>far</i> more comfortable and

inviting than any bed to which he had been used.</p>



<hr class="tb" />



<p>We pass over the thoughts and feelings, the

hopes and fears, the plans and purposes, that

revolved in the mind of Madison during the day

that he was secreted at the house of Mr. Listwell.

The reader will be content to know that nothing

occurred to endanger his liberty, or to excite alarm.

Many were the little attentions bestowed upon

him in his quiet retreat and hiding-place. In the

evening, Mr. Listwell, after treating Madison to a

new suit of winter clothes, and replenishing his

exhausted purse with five dollars, all in silver,

brought out his two-horse wagon, well provided

with buffaloes, and silently started off with him to

Cleveland. They arrived there without interruption,

a few minutes before sunrise the next morning.

Fortunately the steamer Admiral lay at the

wharf, and was to start for Canada at nine o&#8217;clock.

Here the last anticipated danger was surmounted.

It was feared that just at this point the hunters of

men might be on the look-out, and, possibly,

pounce upon their victim. Mr. Listwell saw the

captain of the boat; cautiously sounded him on

the matter of carrying liberty-loving passengers,

before he introduced his precious charge. This

done, Madison was conducted on board. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>

usual generosity this true subject of the emancipating

queen welcomed Madison, and assured him

that he should be safely landed in Canada, free of

charge. Madison now felt himself no more a

piece of merchandise, but a passenger, and, like any

other passenger, going about his business, carrying

with him what belonged to him, and nothing

which rightfully belonged to anybody else.</p>



<p>Wrapped in his new winter suit, snug and

comfortable, a pocket full of silver, safe from his

pursuers, embarked for a free country, Madison

gave every sign of sincere gratitude, and bade his

kind benefactor farewell, with such a grip of the

hand as bespoke a heart full of honest manliness,

and a soul that knew how to appreciate kindness.

It need scarcely be said that Mr. Listwell was

deeply moved by the gratitude and friendship he

had excited in a nature so noble as that of the

fugitive. He went to his home that day with a

joy and gratification which knew no bounds. He

had done something &#8220;to deliver the spoiled out of

the hands of the spoiler,&#8221; he had given bread to

the hungry, and clothes to the naked; he had

befriended a man to whom the laws of his country

forbade all friendship,&mdash;and in proportion to the

odds against his righteous deed, was the delightful

satisfaction that gladdened his heart. On reaching

home, he exclaimed, &#8220;<i>He is safe,&mdash;he is safe,&mdash;he

is safe</i>,&#8221;&mdash;and the cup of his joy was shared

by his excellent lady. The following letter was

received from Madison a few days after.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Windsor, Canada West, Dec. 16, 1840.</span></p>



<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;for such you truly are:&mdash;</p>



<p>Madison is out of the woods at last; I nestle in the

mane of the British lion, protected by his mighty paw

from the talons and the beak of the American eagle.

<span class="smcap">I am free</span>, and breathe an atmosphere too pure for

<i>slaves</i>, slave-hunters, or slave-holders. My heart is full.

As many thanks to you, sir, and to your kind lady, as

there are pebbles on the shores of Lake Erie; and may

the blessing of God rest upon you both. You will never

be forgotten by your profoundly grateful friend,</p>



<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Madison Washington</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Just upon the edge of the great road from

Petersburg, Virginia, to Richmond, and only about

fifteen miles from the latter place, there stands a

somewhat ancient and famous public tavern, quite

notorious in its better days, as being the grand

resort for most of the leading gamblers, horse-racers,

cock-fighters, and slave-traders from all the country

round about. This old rookery, the nucleus of all

sorts of birds, mostly those of ill omen, has, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>

everything else peculiar to Virginia, lost much of

its ancient consequence and splendor; yet it keeps

up some appearance of gaiety and high life, and

is still frequented, even by respectable travellers,

who are unacquainted with its past history and

present condition. Its fine old portico looks well

at a distance, and gives the building an air of

grandeur. A nearer view, however, does little to

sustain this pretension. The house is large, and

its style imposing, but time and dissipation, unfailing

in their results, have made ineffaceable

marks upon it, and it must, in the common course

of events, soon be numbered with the things that

were. The gloomy mantle of ruin is, already, outspread

to envelop it, and its remains, even but

now remind one of a human skull, after the flesh

has mingled with the earth. Old hats and rags

fill the places in the upper windows once occupied

by large panes of glass, and the moulding boards

along the roofing have dropped off from their places,

leaving holes and crevices in the rented wall for

bats and swallows to build their nests in. The

platform of the portico, which fronts the highway

is a rickety affair, its planks are loose, and in

some places entirely gone, leaving effective man-traps

in their stead for nocturnal ramblers. The

wooden pillars, which once supported it, but which

now hang as encumbrances, are all rotten, and

tremble with the touch. A part of the stable, a

fine old structure in its day, which has given comfortable

shelter to hundreds of the noblest steeds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>

&#8220;the Old Dominion&#8221; at once, was blown down

many years ago, and never has been, and probably

never will be, rebuilt. The doors of the barn are

in wretched condition; they will shut with a little

human strength to help their worn out hinges, but

not otherwise. The side of the great building

seen from the road is much discolored in sundry

places by slops poured from the upper windows,

rendering it unsightly and offensive in other

respects. Three or four great dogs, looking as

dull and gloomy as the mansion itself, lie stretched

out along the door-sills under the portico; and

double the number of loafers, some of them completely

rum-ripe, and others ripening, dispose themselves

like so many sentinels about the front of

the house. These latter understand the science of

scraping acquaintance to perfection. They know

every-body, and almost every-body knows them.

Of course, as their title implies, they have no regular

employment. They are (to use an expressive

phrase) <i>hangers on</i>, or still better, they are what

sailors would denominate <i>holders-on to the slack,

in every-body&#8217;s mess, and in nobody&#8217;s watch</i>. They

are, however, as good as the newspaper for the

events of the day, and they sell their knowledge

almost as cheap. Money they seldom have; yet

they always have capital the most reliable. They

make their way with a succeeding traveller by

intelligence gained from a preceding one. All the

great names of Virginia they know by heart, and

have seen their owners often. The history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>

house is folded in their lips, and they rattle off

stories in connection with it, equal to the guides

at Dryburgh Abbey. He must be a shrewd man,

and well skilled in the art of evasion, who gets out

of the hands of these fellows without being at the

expense of a treat.</p>



<p>It was at this old tavern, while on a second visit

to the State of Virginia in 1841, that Mr. Listwell,

unacquainted with the fame of the place, turned

aside, about sunset, to pass the night. Riding up

to the house, he had scarcely dismounted, when

one of the half dozen bar-room fraternity met and

addressed him in a manner exceedingly bland and

accommodating.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fine evening, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Very fine,&#8221; said Mr. Listwell. &#8220;This is a tavern,

I believe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O yes, sir, yes; although you may think it

looks a little the worse for wear, it was once as

good a house as any in Virginy. I make no doubt

if ye spend the night here, you&#8217;ll think it a good

house yet; for there aint a more accommodating

man in the country than you&#8217;ll find the landlord.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Listwell.</i> &#8220;The most I want is a good bed for

myself, and a full manger for my horse. If I get

these, I shall be quite satisfied.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Loafer.</i> &#8220;Well, I alloys like to hear a gentleman

talk for his horse; and just becase the horse

can&#8217;t talk for itself. A man that don&#8217;t care about

his beast, and don&#8217;t look arter it when he&#8217;s travelling,

aint much in my eye anyhow. Now, sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>

I likes a horse, and I&#8217;ll guarantee your horse will

be taken good care on here. That old stable, for

all you see it looks so shabby now, once sheltered

the great <i>Eclipse</i>, when he run here agin <i>Batchelor</i>

and <i>Jumping Jemmy</i>. Them was fast horses, but

he beat &#8217;em both.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Listwell.</i> &#8220;Indeed.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Loafer.</i> &#8220;Well, I rather reckon you&#8217;ve travelled

a right smart distance to-day, from the look of

your horse?&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Listwell.</i> &#8220;Forty miles only.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Loafer.</i> &#8220;Well! I&#8217;ll be darned if that aint a

pretty good <i>only</i>. Mister, that beast of yours is a

singed cat, I warrant you. I never see&#8217;d a creature

like that that wasn&#8217;t good on the road. You&#8217;ve

come about forty miles, then?&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Listwell.</i> &#8220;Yes, yes, and a pretty good pace at

that.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Loafer.</i> &#8220;You&#8217;re somewhat in a hurry, then, I

make no doubt? I reckon I could guess if I

would, what you&#8217;re going to Richmond for? It

wouldn&#8217;t be much of a guess either; for it&#8217;s rumored

hereabouts, that there&#8217;s to be the greatest

sale of niggers at Richmond to-morrow that has

taken place there in a long time; and I&#8217;ll be

bound you&#8217;re a going there to have a hand in it.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Listwell.</i> &#8220;Why, you must think, then, that

there&#8217;s money to be made at that business?&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Loafer.</i> &#8220;Well, &#8217;pon my honor, sir, I never

made any that way myself; but it stands to reason

that it&#8217;s a money making business; for almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>

all other business in Virginia is dropped to engage

in this. One thing is sartain, I never see&#8217;d a nigger-buyer

yet that hadn&#8217;t a plenty of money, and

he wasn&#8217;t as free with it as water. I has known

one on &#8217;em to treat as high as twenty times in a

night; and, ginerally speaking, they&#8217;s men of edication,

and knows all about the government. The

fact is, sir, I alloys like to hear &#8217;em talk, bekase I

alloys can learn something from them.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Listwell.</i> &#8220;What may I call your name, sir?&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Loafer.</i> &#8220;Well, now, they calls me Wilkes.

I&#8217;m known all around by the gentlemen that

comes here. They all knows old Wilkes.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Listwell.</i> &#8220;Well, Wilkes, you seem to be acquainted

here, and I see you have a strong liking

for a horse. Be so good as to speak a kind word

for mine to the hostler to-night, and you&#8217;ll not

lose anything by it.&#8221;</p>



<p><i>Loafer.</i> &#8220;Well, sir, I see you don&#8217;t say much,

but you&#8217;ve got an insight into things. It&#8217;s alloys

wise to get the good will of them that&#8217;s acquainted

about a tavern; for a man don&#8217;t know when he

goes into a house what may happen, or how much

he may need a friend.&#8221; Here the loafer gave Mr.

Listwell a significant grin, which expressed a sort

of triumphant pleasure at having, as he supposed,

by his tact succeeded in placing so fine appearing

a gentleman under obligations to him.</p>



<p>The pleasure, however, was mutual; for there

was something so insinuating in the glance of this

loquacious customer, that Mr. Listwell was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>

glad to get quit of him, and to do so more successfully,

he ordered his supper to be brought to him

in his private room, private to the eye, but not to

the ear. This room was directly over the bar, and

the plastering being off, nothing but pine boards

and naked laths separated him from the disagreeable

company below,&mdash;he could easily hear what

was said in the bar-room, and was rather glad of

the advantage it afforded, for, as you shall see, it

furnished him important hints as to the manner

and deportment he should assume during his stay

at that tavern.</p>



<p>Mr. Listwell says he had got into his room but

a few moments, when he heard the officious Wilkes

below, in a tone of disappointment, exclaim,

&#8220;Whar&#8217;s that gentleman?&#8221; Wilkes was evidently

expecting to meet with his friend at the bar-room,

on his return, and had no doubt of his doing the

handsome thing. &#8220;He has gone to his room,&#8221;

answered the landlord, &#8220;and has ordered his supper

to be brought to him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Here some one shouted out, &#8220;Who is he,

Wilkes? Where&#8217;s he going?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, now, I&#8217;ll be hanged if I know; but I&#8217;m

willing to make any man a bet of this old hat

agin a five dollar bill, that that gent is as full of

money as a dog is of fleas. He&#8217;s going down to

Richmond to buy niggers, I make no doubt.

He&#8217;s no fool, I warrant ye.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, he acts d&mdash;d strange,&#8221; said another,

&#8220;anyhow. I likes to see a man, when he comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>

up to a tavern, to come straight into the bar-room,

and show that he&#8217;s a man among men. Nobody

was going to bite him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, I don&#8217;t blame him a bit for not coming

in here. That man knows his business, and means

to take care on his money,&#8221; answered Wilkes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wilkes, you&#8217;re a fool. You only say that,

becase you hope to get a few coppers out on him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You only measure my corn by your half-bushel,

I won&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re only mad becase I

got the chance of speaking to him first.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O Wilkes! you&#8217;re known here. You&#8217;ll praise

up any body that will give you a copper; besides,

&#8217;tis my opinion that that fellow who took his long

slab-sides up stairs, for all the world just like a

half-scared woman, afraid to look honest men in

the face, is a <i>Northerner</i>, and as mean as dishwater.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now what will you bet of that,&#8221; said Wilkes.</p>



<p>The speaker said, &#8220;I make no bets with you,

&#8217;kase you can get that fellow up stairs there to

say anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Wilkes, &#8220;I am willing to bet any

man in the company that <i>that</i> gentleman is a <i>nigger</i>-buyer.

He didn&#8217;t tell me so right down, but

I reckon I knows enough about men to give a

pretty clean guess as to what they are arter.&#8221;</p>



<p>The dispute as to <i>who</i> Mr. Listwell was, what

his business, where he was going, etc., was kept

up with much animation for some time, and more

than once threatened a serious disturbance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>

peace. Wilkes had his friends as well as his

opponents. After this sharp debate, the company

amused themselves by drinking whiskey, and telling

stories. The latter consisting of quarrels,

fights, <i>rencontres</i>, and duels, in which distinguished

persons of that neighborhood, and frequenters of

that house, had been actors. Some of these stories

were frightful enough, and were told, too, with a

relish which bespoke the pleasure of the parties

with the horrid scenes they portrayed. It would

not be proper here to give the reader any idea of

the vulgarity and dark profanity which rolled, as

&#8220;a sweet morsel,&#8221; under these corrupt tongues.

A more brutal set of creatures, perhaps, never congregated.</p>



<p>Disgusted, and a little alarmed withal, Mr. Listwell,

who was not accustomed to such entertainment,

at length retired, but not to sleep. He was

<i>too</i> much wrought upon by what he had heard to

rest quietly, and what snatches of sleep he got,

were interrupted by dreams which were anything

than pleasant. At eleven o&#8217;clock, there seemed to

be several hundreds of persons crowding into the

house. A loud and confused clamour, cursing and

cracking of whips, and the noise of chains startled

him from his bed; for a moment he would have

given the half of his farm in Ohio to have been at

home. This uproar was kept up with undulating

course, till near morning. There was loud laughing,&mdash;loud

singing,&mdash;loud cursing,&mdash;and yet

there seemed to be weeping and mourning in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>

midst of all. Mr. Listwell said he had heard

enough during the forepart of the night to convince

him that a buyer of men and women stood

the best chance of being respected. And he, therefore,

thought it best to say nothing which might

undo the favorable opinion that had been formed

of him in the bar-room by at least one of the fraternity

that swarmed about it. While he would

not avow himself a purchaser of slaves, he deemed

it not prudent to disavow it. He felt that he

might, properly, refuse to cast such a pearl before

parties which, to him, were worse than swine. To

reveal himself, and to impart a knowledge of his

real character and sentiments would, to say the

least, be imparting intelligence with the certainty

of seeing it and himself both abused. Mr. Listwell

confesses, that this reasoning did not altogether

satisfy his conscience, for, hating slavery as he did,

and regarding it to be the immediate duty of every

man to cry out against it, &#8220;without compromise

and without concealment,&#8221; it was hard for him to

admit to himself the possibility of circumstances

wherein a man might, properly, hold his tongue on

the subject. Having as little of the spirit of a martyr

as Erasmus, he concluded, like the latter, that

it was wiser to trust the mercy of God for his soul,

than the humanity of slave-traders for his body.

Bodily fear, not conscientious scruples, prevailed.</p>



<p>In this spirit he rose early in the morning, manifesting

no surprise at what he had heard during the

night. His quondam friend was soon at his elbow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>

boring him with all sorts of questions. All, however,

directed to find out his character, business, residence,

purposes, and destination. With the most

perfect appearance of good nature and carelessness,

Mr. Listwell evaded these meddlesome inquiries,

and turned conversation to general topics, leaving

himself and all that specially pertained to him, out

of discussion. Disengaging himself from their troublesome

companionship, he made his way towards

an old bowling-alley, which was connected with

the house, and which, like all the rest, was in very

bad repair.</p>



<p>On reaching the alley Mr. Listwell saw, for the

first time in his life, a slave-gang on their way to

market. A sad sight truly. Here were one hundred

and thirty human beings,&mdash;children of a

common Creator&mdash;guilty of no crime&mdash;men and

women, with hearts, minds, and deathless spirits,

chained and fettered, and bound for the market, in

a christian country,&mdash;in a country boasting of

its liberty, independence, and high civilization!

Humanity converted into merchandise, and linked

in iron bands, with no regard to decency or humanity!

All sizes, ages, and sexes, mothers, fathers,

daughters, brothers, sisters,&mdash;all huddled together,

on their way to market to be sold and separated

from home, and from each other <i>forever</i>. And

all to fill the pockets of men too lazy to work for

an honest living, and who gain their fortune by

plundering the helpless, and trafficking in the souls

and sinews of men. As he gazed upon this revolting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

and heart-rending scene, our informant said he

almost doubted the existence of a God of justice!

And he stood wondering that the earth did not

open and swallow up such wickedness.</p>



<p>In the midst of these reflections, and while running

his eye up and down the fettered ranks, he

met the glance of one whose face he thought he

had seen before. To be resolved, he moved towards

the spot. It was <span class="smcap">Madison Washington</span>! Here

was a scene for the pencil! Had Mr. Listwell

been confronted by one risen from the dead, he

could not have been more appalled. He was completely

stunned. A thunderbolt could not have

struck him more dumb. He stood, for a few

moments, as motionless as one petrified; collecting

himself, he at length exclaimed, &#8220;<i>Madison! is

that you?</i>&#8221;</p>



<p>The noble fugitive, but little less astonished than

himself, answered cheerily, &#8220;O yes, sir, they&#8217;ve

got me again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thoughtless of consequences for the moment,

Mr. Listwell ran up to his old friend, placing his

hands upon his shoulders, and looked him in the

face! Speechless they stood gazing at each other

as if to be doubly resolved that there was no mistake

about the matter, till Madison motioned his

friend away, intimating a fear lest the keepers

should find him there, and suspect him of tampering

with the slaves.</p>



<p>&#8220;They will soon be out to look after us. You

can come when they go to breakfast, and I will

tell you all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>Pleased with this arrangement, Mr. Listwell

passed out of the alley; but only just in time to

save himself, for, while near the door, he observed

three men making their way to the alley. The

thought occurred to him to await their arrival, as

the best means of diverting the ever ready suspicions

of the guilty.</p>



<p>While the scene between Mr. Listwell and his

friend Madison was going on, the other slaves

stood as mute spectators,&mdash;at a loss to know

what all this could mean. As he left, he heard

the man chained to Madison ask, &#8220;Who is that

gentleman?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He is a friend of mine. I cannot tell you now.

Suffice it to say he is a friend. You shall hear more

of him before long, but mark me! whatever shall

pass between that gentleman and me, in your

hearing, I pray you will say nothing about it.

We are all chained here together,&mdash;ours is a

common lot; and that gentleman is not less <i>your</i>

friend than <i>mine</i>.&#8221; At these words, all mysterious

as they were, the unhappy company gave

signs of satisfaction and hope. It seems that

Madison, by that mesmeric power which is the invariable

accompaniment of genius, had already

won the confidence of the gang, and was a sort of

general-in-chief among them.</p>



<p>By this time the keepers arrived. A horrid

trio, well fitted for their demoniacal work. Their

uncombed hair came down over foreheads &#8220;<i>villainously

low</i>,&#8221; and with eyes, mouths, and noses to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

match. &#8220;Hallo! hallo!&#8221; they growled out as

they entered. &#8220;Are you all there!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All here,&#8221; said Madison.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, well, that&#8217;s right! your journey will

soon be over. You&#8217;ll be in Richmond by eleven

to-day, and then you&#8217;ll have an easy time on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I say, gal, what in the devil are you crying

about?&#8221; said one of them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you something

to cry about, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; This was

said to a girl, apparently not more than twelve

years old, who had been weeping bitterly. She

had, probably, left behind her a loving mother,

affectionate sisters, brothers, and friends, and her

tears were but the natural expression of her sorrow,

and the only solace. But the dealers in human

flesh have <i>no</i> respect for such sorrow. They

look upon it as a protest against their cruel injustice,

and they are prompt to punish it.</p>



<p>This is a puzzle not easily solved. <i>How</i> came

he here? what can I do for him? may I not even

now be in some way compromised in this affair?

were thoughts that troubled Mr. Listwell, and

made him eager for the promised opportunity of

speaking to Madison.</p>



<p>The bell now sounded for breakfast, and keepers

and drivers, with pistols and bowie-knives

gleaming from their belts, hurried in, as if to get

the best places. Taking the chance now afforded,

Mr. Listwell hastened back to the bowling-alley.

Reaching Madison, he said, &#8220;Now <i>do</i> tell me all

about the matter. Do you know me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Madison, &#8220;I know you well,

and shall never forget you nor that cold and

dreary night you gave me shelter. I must be

short,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;for they&#8217;ll soon be out

again. This, then, is the story in brief. On

reaching Canada, and getting over the excitement

of making my escape, sir, my thoughts turned to

my poor wife, who had well deserved my love by

her virtuous fidelity and undying affection for me.

I could not bear the thought of leaving her in the

cruel jaws of slavery, without making an effort

to rescue her. First, I tried to get money to buy

her; but oh! the process was <i>too slow</i>. I despaired

of accomplishing it. She was in all my

thoughts by day, and my dreams by night. At

times I could almost hear her voice, saying, &#8216;O

Madison! Madison! will you then leave me here?

can you leave me here to die? No! no! you will

come! you will come!&#8217; I was wretched. I lost

my appetite. I could neither work, eat, nor sleep,

till I resolved to hazard my own liberty, to gain

that of my wife! But I must be short. Six

weeks ago I reached my old master&#8217;s place. I

laid about the neighborhood nearly a week, watching

my chance, and, finally, I ventured upon the

desperate attempt to reach my poor wife&#8217;s room by

means of a ladder. I reached the window, but

the noise in raising it frightened my wife, and she

screamed and fainted. I took her in my arms,

and was descending the ladder, when the dogs began

to bark furiously, and before I could get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>

the woods the white folks were roused. The cool

night air soon restored my wife, and she readily

recognized me. We made the best of our way to

the woods, but it was now <i>too</i> late,&mdash;the dogs were

after us as though they would have torn us to

pieces. It was all over with me now! My old

master and his two sons ran out with loaded

rifles, and before we were out of gunshot, our

ears were assailed with &#8216;<i>Stop! stop! or be shot

down</i>.&#8217; Nevertheless we ran on. Seeing that

we gave no heed to their calls, they fired, and my

poor wife fell by my side dead, while I received

but a slight flesh wound. I now became desperate,

and stood my ground, and awaited their

attack over her dead body. They rushed upon me,

with their rifles in hand. I parried their blows,

and fought them &#8217;till I was knocked down and

overpowered.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh! it was madness to have returned,&#8221; said

Mr. Listwell.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sir, I could not be free with the galling

thought that my poor wife was still a slave. With

her in slavery, my body, not my spirit, was free.

I was taken to the house,&mdash;chained to a ring-bolt,&mdash;my

wounds dressed. I was kept there three

days. All the slaves, for miles around, were brought

to see me. Many slave-holders came with their

slaves, using me as proof of the completeness of

their power, and of the impossibility of slaves getting

away. I was taunted, jeered at, and berated

by them, in a manner that pierced me to the soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>

Thank God, I was able to smother my rage, and

to bear it all with seeming composure. After my

wounds were nearly healed, I was taken to a tree

and stripped, and I received sixty lashes on my

naked back. A few days after, I was sold to a

slave-trader, and placed in this gang for the New

Orleans market.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think your master would sell you to

me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O no, sir! I was sold on condition of my being

taken South. Their motive is revenge.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, then,&#8221; said Mr. Listwell, &#8220;I fear I can

do nothing for you. Put your trust in God, and

bear your sad lot with the manly fortitude which

becomes a man. I shall see you at Richmond,

but don&#8217;t recognize me.&#8221; Saying this, Mr. Listwell

handed Madison ten dollars; said a few

words to the other slaves; received their hearty

&#8220;God bless you,&#8221; and made his way to the house.</p>



<p>Fearful of exciting suspicion by too long delay,

our friend went to the breakfast table, with the

air of one who half reproved the greediness of

those who rushed in at the sound of the bell. A

cup of coffee was all that he could manage. His

feelings were too bitter and excited, and his heart

was too full with the fate of poor Madison (whom

he loved as well as admired) to relish his breakfast;

and although he sat long after the company had

left the table, he really did little more than change

the position of his knife and fork. The strangeness

of meeting again one whom he had met on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>

two several occasions before, under extraordinary

circumstances, was well calculated to suggest the

idea that a supernatural power, a wakeful providence,

or an inexorable fate, had linked their destiny

together; and that no efforts of his could disentangle

him from the mysterious web of circumstances

which enfolded him.</p>



<p>On leaving the table, Mr. Listwell nerved himself

up and walked firmly into the bar-room. He

was at once greeted again by that talkative chatter-box,

Mr. Wilkes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s a likely set of niggers in the alley

there,&#8221; said Wilkes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re fine looking fellows, one of them

I should like to purchase, and for him I would be

willing to give a handsome sum.&#8221;</p>



<p>Turning to one of his comrades, and with a

grin of victory, Wilkes said, &#8220;Aha, Bill, did you

hear that? I told you I know&#8217;d that gentleman

wanted to buy niggers, and would bid as high as

any purchaser in the market.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; said Listwell, &#8220;don&#8217;t be too

loud in your praise, you are old enough to know

that prices rise when purchasers are plenty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; said Wilkes, &#8220;I see you

knows the ropes&mdash;and there&#8217;s not a man in old

Virginy whom I&#8217;d rather help to make a good

bargain than you, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr. Listwell here threw a dollar at Wilkes,

(which the latter caught with a dexterous hand,)

saying, &#8220;Take that for your kind good will.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>

Wilkes held up the dollar to his right eye, with a

grin of victory, and turned to the morose grumbler

in the corner who had questioned the liberality of

a man of whom he knew nothing.</p>



<p>Mr. Listwell now stood as well with the company

as any other occupant of the bar-room.</p>



<p>We pass over the hurry and bustle, the brutal

vociferations of the slave-drivers in getting their

unhappy gang in motion for Richmond; and we

need not narrate every application of the lash to

those who faltered in the journey. Mr. Listwell

followed the train at a long distance, with a sad

heart; and on reaching Richmond, left his horse

at a hotel, and made his way to the wharf in the

direction of which he saw the slave-coffle driven.

He was just in time to see the whole company

embark for New Orleans. The thought struck

him that, while mixing with the multitude, he

might do his friend Madison one last service, and

he stept into a hardware store and purchased three

strong <i>files</i>. These he took with him, and standing

near the small boat, which lay in waiting to

bear the company by parcels to the side of the

brig that lay in the stream, he managed, as Madison

passed him, to slip the files into his pocket,

and at once darted back among the crowd.</p>



<p>All the company now on board, the imperious

voice of the captain sounded, and instantly a dozen

hardy seamen were in the rigging, hurrying aloft

to unfurl the broad canvas of our Baltimore built

American Slaver. The sailors hung about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

ropes, like so many black cats, now in the round-tops,

now in the cross-trees, now on the yard-arms;

all was bluster and activity. Soon the broad fore

topsail, the royal and top gallant sail were spread

to the breeze. Round went the heavy windlass,

clank, clank went the fall-bit,&mdash;the anchors

weighed,&mdash;jibs, mainsails, and topsails hauled to

the wind, and the long, low, black slaver, with her

cargo of human flesh, careened and moved forward

to the sea.</p>



<p>Mr. Listwell stood on the shore, and watched the

slaver till the last speck of her upper sails faded

from sight, and announced the limit of human

vision. &#8220;Farewell! farewell! brave and true man!

God grant that brighter skies may smile upon

your future than have yet looked down upon

your thorny pathway.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying this to himself, our friend lost no time

in completing his business, and in making his

way homewards, gladly shaking off from his feet

the dust of Old Virginia.</p>

<p>What a world of inconsistency, as well as of

wickedness, is suggested by the smooth and gliding

phrase, <span class="smcap">American Slave Trade</span>; and how

strange and perverse is that moral sentiment which

loathes, execrates, and brands as piracy and as

deserving of death the carrying away into captivity

men, women, and children from the <i>African

coast</i>; but which is neither shocked nor disturbed

by a similar traffic, carried on with the same

motives and purposes, and characterized by even

<i>more</i> odious peculiarities on the coast of our

<small>MODEL REPUBLIC</small>. We execrate and hang the

wretch guilty of this crime on the coast of Guinea,

while we respect and applaud the guilty participators

in this murderous business on the enlightened

shores of the Chesapeake. The inconsistency

is so flagrant and glaring, that it would seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>

cast a doubt on the doctrine of the innate moral

sense of mankind.</p>



<p>Just two months after the sailing of the Virginia

slave brig, which the reader has seen move off to

sea so proudly with her human cargo for the New

Orleans market, there chanced to meet, in the

Marine Coffee-house at Richmond, a company of

<i>ocean birds</i>, when the following conversation, which

throws some light on the subsequent history, not

only of Madison Washington, but of the hundred

and thirty human beings with whom we last saw

him chained.</p>



<p>&#8220;I say, shipmate, you had rather rough weather

on your late passage to Orleans?&#8221; said Jack Williams,

a regular old salt, tauntingly, to a trim,

compact, manly looking person, who proved to be

the first mate of the slave brig in question.</p>



<p>&#8220;Foul play, as well as foul weather,&#8221; replied the

firmly knit personage, evidently but little inclined

to enter upon a subject which terminated so ingloriously

to the captain and officers of the American

slaver.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, betwixt you and me,&#8221; said Williams,

&#8220;that whole affair on board of the Creole was miserably

and disgracefully managed. Those black

rascals got the upper hand of ye altogether; and,

in my opinion, the whole disaster was the result

of ignorance of the real character of <i>darkies</i> in general.

With half a dozen <i>resolute</i> white men, (I

say it not boastingly,) I could have had the rascals

in irons in ten minutes, not because I&#8217;m so strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>

but I know how to manage &#8217;em. With my back

against the <i>caboose</i>, I could, myself, have flogged

a dozen of them; and had I been on board, by

every monster of the deep, every black devil of &#8217;em

all would have had his neck stretched from the

yard-arm. Ye made a mistake in yer manner of

fighting &#8217;em. All that is needed in dealing with

a set of rebellious <i>darkies</i>, is to show that yer not

afraid of &#8217;em. For my own part, I would not

honor a dozen niggers by pointing a gun at one

on &#8217;em,&mdash;a good stout whip, or a stiff rope&#8217;s end,

is better than all the guns at Old Point to quell a

<i>nigger</i> insurrection. Why, sir, to take a gun to a

<i>nigger</i> is the best way you can select to tell him

you are afraid of him, and the best way of inviting

his attack.&#8221;</p>



<p>This speech made quite a sensation among the

company, and a part of them indicated solicitude

for the answer which might be made to it. Our

first mate replied, &#8220;Mr. Williams, all that you&#8217;ve

now said sounds very well <i>here</i> on shore, where,

perhaps, you have studied negro character. I do

not profess to understand the subject as well as

yourself; but it strikes me, you apply the same

rule in dissimilar cases. It is quite easy to talk of

flogging niggers here on land, where you have the

sympathy of the community, and the whole physical

force of the government, State and national,

at your command; and where, if a negro shall lift

his hand against a white man, the whole community,

with one accord, are ready to unite in shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>

him down. I say, in such circumstances, it&#8217;s

easy to talk of flogging negroes and of negro cowardice;

but, sir, I deny that the negro is, naturally,

a coward, or that your theory of managing slaves

will stand the test of <i>salt</i> water. It may do very

well for an overseer, a contemptible hireling, to take

advantage of fears already in existence, and which

his presence has no power to inspire; to swagger

about whip in hand, and discourse on the timidity

and cowardice of negroes; for they have a smooth

sea and a fair wind. It is one thing to manage a

company of slaves on a Virginia plantation, and

quite another thing to quell an insurrection on the

lonely billows of the Atlantic, where every breeze

speaks of courage and liberty. For the negro to

act cowardly on shore, may be to act wisely; and

I&#8217;ve some doubts whether <i>you</i>, Mr. Williams,

would find it very convenient were you a slave in

Algiers, to raise your hand against the bayonets of

a whole government.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By George, shipmate,&#8221; said Williams, &#8220;you&#8217;re

coming rather <i>too</i> near. Either I&#8217;ve fallen very

low in your estimation, or your notions of negro

courage have got up a button-hole too high. Now

I more than ever wish I&#8217;d been on board of that

luckless craft. I&#8217;d have given ye practical evidence

of the truth of my theory. I don&#8217;t doubt there&#8217;s

some difference in being at sea. But a nigger&#8217;s a

nigger, on sea or land; and is a coward, find him

where you will; a drop of blood from one on &#8217;em

will skeer a hundred. A knock on the nose, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>

kick on the shin, will tame the wildest &#8216;<i>darkey</i>&#8217;

you can fetch me. I say again, and will stand by

it, I could, with half a dozen good men, put the

whole nineteen on &#8217;em in irons, and have carried

them safe to New Orleans too. Mind, I don&#8217;t

blame you, but I do say, and every gentleman here

will bear me out in it, that the fault was somewhere,

or them niggers would never have got off as

they have done. For my part I feel ashamed to

have the idea go abroad, that a ship load of slaves

can&#8217;t be safely taken from Richmond to New

Orleans. I should like, merely to redeem the

character of Virginia sailors, to take charge of a

ship load on &#8217;em to-morrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>Williams went on in this strain, occasionally

casting an imploring glance at the company for

applause for his wit, and sympathy for his contempt

of negro courage. He had, evidently, however,

waked up the wrong passenger; for besides

being in the right, his opponent carried that in his

eye which marked him a man not to be trifled with.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said the sturdy mate, &#8220;you can

select your own method for distinguishing yourself;&mdash;the

path of ambition in this direction is

quite open to you in Virginia, and I&#8217;ve no doubt

that you will be highly appreciated and compensated

for all your valiant achievements in that line;

but for myself, while I do not profess to be a giant,

I have resolved never to set my foot on the deck of

a slave ship, either as officer, or common sailor

again; I have got enough of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>&#8220;Indeed! indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Williams, derisively.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>indeed</i>,&#8221; echoed the mate; &#8220;but don&#8217;t

misunderstand me. It is not the high value that

I set upon my life that makes me say what I have

said; yet I&#8217;m resolved never to endanger my life

again in a cause which my conscience does not

approve. I dare say <i>here</i> what many men <i>feel</i>,

but <i>dare not speak</i>, that this whole slave-trading

business is a disgrace and scandal to Old Virginia.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hold! hold on! shipmate,&#8221; said Williams,

&#8220;I hardly thought you&#8217;d have shown your colors

so soon,&mdash;I&#8217;ll be hanged if you&#8217;re not as good an

abolitionist as Garrison himself.&#8221;</p>



<p>The mate now rose from his chair, manifesting

some excitement. &#8220;What do you mean, sir,&#8221;

said he, in a commanding tone. &#8220;<i>That man does

not live who shall offer me an insult with impunity.</i>&#8221;</p>



<p>The effect of these words was marked; and the

company clustered around. Williams, in an apologetic

tone, said, &#8220;Shipmate! keep your temper.

I mean&#8217;t no insult. We all know that Tom Grant

is no coward, and what I said about your being an

abolitionist was simply this: you <i>might</i> have put

down them black mutineers and murderers, but

your conscience held you back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In that, too,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;you were mistaken.

I did all that any man with equal strength and

presence of mind could have done. The fact is,

Mr. Williams, you underrate the courage as well

as the skill of these negroes, and further, you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>

not seem to have been correctly informed about

the case in hand at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All I know about it is,&#8221; said Williams, &#8220;that on

the ninth day after you left Richmond, a dozen or

two of the niggers ye had on board, came on deck

and took the ship from you;&mdash;had her steered

into a British port, where, by the by, every woolly

head of them went ashore and was free. Now I

take this to be a discreditable piece of business,

and one demanding explanation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There are a great many discreditable things in

the world,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;For a ship to go down

under a calm sky is, upon the first flush of it, disgraceful

either to sailors or caulkers. But when

we learn, that by some mysterious disturbance in

nature, the waters parted beneath, and swallowed

the ship up, we lose our indignation and disgust

in lamentation of the disaster, and in awe of the

Power which controls the elements.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Very true, very true,&#8221; said Williams, &#8220;I should

be very glad to have an explanation which would

relieve the affair of its present discreditable features.

I have desired to see you ever since you

got home, and to learn from you a full statement

of the facts in the case. To me the whole thing

seems unaccountable. I cannot see how a dozen

or two of ignorant negroes, not one of whom had

ever been to sea before, and all of them were

closely ironed between decks, should be able to

get their fetters off, rush out of the hatchway in

open daylight, kill two white men, the one the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>

captain and the other their master, and then carry

the ship into a British port, where every

&#8216;<i>darkey</i>&#8217; of them was set free. There must have

been great carelessness, or cowardice somewhere!&#8221;</p>



<p>The company which had listened in silence

during most of this discussion, now became much

excited. One said, I agree with Williams; and

several said the thing looks black enough. After

the temporary tumultous exclamations had subsided,&mdash;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;how you regard this case,

and how difficult it will be for me to render our

ship&#8217;s company blameless in your eyes. Nevertheless,

I will state the fact precisely as they came

under my own observation. Mr. Williams speaks

of &#8216;ignorant negroes,&#8217; and, as a general rule, they

are ignorant; but had he been on board the <i>Creole</i>

as I was, he would have seen cause to admit

that there are exceptions to this general rule. The

leader of the mutiny in question was just as

shrewd a fellow as ever I met in my life, and was

as well fitted to lead in a dangerous enterprise as

any one white man in ten thousand. The name

of this man, strange to say, (ominous of greatness,)

was <span class="smcap">Madison Washington</span>. In the short

time he had been on board, he had secured the

confidence of every officer. The negroes fairly

worshipped him. His manner and bearing were

such, that no one could suspect him of a murderous

purpose. The only feeling with which we

regarded him was, that he was a powerful, good-disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>

negro. He seldom spake to any one,

and when he did speak, it was with the utmost

propriety. His words were well chosen, and his

pronunciation equal to that of any schoolmaster.

It was a mystery to us <i>where</i> he got his knowledge

of language; but as little was said to him,

none of us knew the extent of his intelligence

and ability till it was too late. It seems he

brought three files with him on board, and must

have gone to work upon his fetters the first night

out; and he must have worked well at that; for on

the day of the rising, he got the irons <i>off eighteen</i>

besides himself.</p>



<p>&#8220;The attack began just about twilight in the

evening. Apprehending a squall, I had commanded

the second mate to order all hands on

deck, to take in sail. A few minutes before this

I had seen Madison&#8217;s head above the hatchway,

looking out upon the white-capped waves at the

leeward. I think I never saw him look more

good-natured. I stood just about midship, on

the larboard side. The captain was pacing the

quarter-deck on the starboard side, in company

with Mr. Jameson, the owner of most of the

slaves on board. Both were armed. I had just

told the men to lay aloft, and was looking to see

my orders obeyed, when I heard the discharge of

a pistol on the starboard side; and turning suddenly

around, the very deck seemed covered with

fiends from the pit. The nineteen negroes were

all on deck, with their broken fetters in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>

hands, rushing in all directions. I put my hand

quickly in my pocket to draw out my jack-knife;

but before I could draw it, I was knocked senseless

to the deck. When I came to myself, (which

I did in a few minutes, I suppose, for it was yet

quite light,) there was not a white man on deck.

The sailors were all aloft in the rigging, and dared

not come down. Captain Clarke and Mr. Jameson

lay stretched on the quarter-deck,&mdash;both dying,&mdash;while

Madison himself stood at the helm

unhurt.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was completely weakened by the loss of blood,

and had not recovered from the stunning blow

which felled me to the deck; but it was a little

too much for me, even in my prostrate condition,

to see our good brig commanded by a <i>black murderer</i>.

So I called out to the men to come down

and take the ship, or die in the attempt. Suiting

the action to the word, I started aft. You murderous

villain, said I, to the imp at the helm, and

rushed upon him to deal him a blow, when he

pushed me back with his strong, black arm, as

though I had been a boy of twelve. I looked

around for the men. They were still in the rigging.

Not one had come down. I started towards

Madison again. The rascal now told me

to stand back. &#8216;Sir,&#8217; said he, &#8216;your life is in my

hands. I could have killed you a dozen times

over during this last half hour, and could kill you

now. You call me a <i>black murderer</i>. I am not

a murderer. God is my witness that <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

not <i>malice</i>, is the motive for this night&#8217;s work. I

have done no more to those dead men yonder,

than they would have done to me in like circumstances.

We have struck for our freedom, and if

a true man&#8217;s heart be in you, you will honor us

for the deed. We have done that which you

applaud your fathers for doing, and if we are murderers,

<i>so were they</i>.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt little disposition to reply to this impudent

speech. By heaven, it disarmed me. The

fellow loomed up before me. I forgot his blackness

in the dignity of his manner, and the eloquence

of his speech. It seemed as if the souls

of both the great dead (whose names he bore)

had entered him. To the sailors in the rigging he

said: &#8216;Men! the battle is over,&mdash;your captain is

dead. I have complete command of this vessel.

All resistance to my authority will be in vain.

My men have won their liberty, with no other

weapons but their own <small>BROKEN FETTERS</small>. We are

nineteen in number. We do not thirst for your

blood, we demand only our rightful freedom. Do

not flatter yourselves that I am ignorant of chart

or compass. I know both. We are now only

about sixty miles from Nassau. Come down,

and do your duty. Land us in Nassau, and not

a hair of your heads shall be hurt.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I shouted, <i>Stay where you are, men</i>,&mdash;when

a sturdy black fellow ran at me with a handspike,

and would have split my head open, but for the

interference of Madison, who darted between me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>

and the blow. &#8216;I know what you are up to,&#8217; said

the latter to me. &#8216;You want to navigate this brig

into a slave port, where you would have us all

hanged; but you&#8217;ll miss it; before this brig shall

touch a slave-cursed shore while I am on board,

I will myself put a match to the magazine, and

blow her, and be blown with her, into a thousand

fragments. Now I have saved your life twice

within these last twenty minutes,&mdash;for, when you

lay helpless on deck, my men were about to kill

you. I held them in check. And if you now

(seeing I am your friend and not your enemy)

persist in your resistance to my authority, I give

you fair warning, <small>YOU SHALL DIE</small>.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Saying this to me, he cast a glance into the

rigging where the terror-stricken sailors were clinging,

like so many frightened monkeys, and commanded

them to come down, in a tone from which

there was no appeal; for four men stood by with

muskets in hand, ready at the word of command

to shoot them down.</p>



<p>&#8220;I now became satisfied that resistance was out

of the question; that my best policy was to put

the brig into Nassau, and secure the assistance of

the American consul at that port. I felt sure that

the authorities would enable us to secure the murderers,

and bring them to trial.</p>



<p>&#8220;By this time the apprehended squall had burst

upon us. The wind howled furiously,&mdash;the ocean

was white with foam, which, on account of the

darkness, we could see only by the quick flashes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>

lightning that darted occasionally from the angry

sky. All was alarm and confusion. Hideous cries

came up from the slave women. Above the roaring

billows a succession of heavy thunder rolled

along, swelling the terrific din. Owing to the

great darkness, and a sudden shift of the wind,

we found ourselves in the trough of the sea. When

shipping a heavy sea over the starboard bow, the

bodies of the captain and Mr. Jameson were

washed overboard. For awhile we had dearer

interests to look after than slave property. A

more savage thunder-gust never swept the ocean.

Our brig rolled and creaked as if every bolt would

be started, and every thread of oakum would be

pressed out of the seams. To the pumps! to the

pumps! I cried, but not a sailor would quit his

grasp. Fortunately this squall soon passed over,

or we must have been food for sharks.</p>



<p>&#8220;During all the storm, Madison stood firmly at

the helm,&mdash;his keen eye fixed upon the binnacle.

He was not indifferent to the dreadful hurricane;

yet he met it with the equanimity of an old sailor.

He was silent but not agitated. The first words

he uttered after the storm had slightly subsided,

were characteristic of the man. &#8216;Mr. mate, you

cannot write the bloody laws of slavery on those

restless billows. The ocean, if not the land, is free.&#8217;

I confess, gentlemen, I felt myself in the presence

of a superior man; one who, had he been a white

man, I would have followed willingly and gladly

in any honorable enterprise. Our difference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

color was the only ground for difference of action.

It was not that his principles were wrong in the

abstract; for they are the principles of 1776. But

I could not bring myself to recognize their application

to one whom I deemed my inferior.</p>



<p>&#8220;But to my story. What happened now is soon

told. Two hours after the frightful tempest had

spent itself, we were plump at the wharf in Nassau.

I sent two of our men immediately to our consul

with a statement of facts, requesting his interference

in our behalf. What he did, or whither

he did anything, I don&#8217;t know; but, by order of

the authorities, a company of <i>black</i> soldiers came

on board, for the purpose, as they said, of protecting

the property. These impudent rascals,

when I called on them to assist me in keeping the

slaves on board, sheltered themselves adroitly

under their instructions only to protect property,&mdash;and

said they did not recognize <i>persons</i> as <i>property</i>.

I told them that by the laws of Virginia and the

laws of the United States, the slaves on board

were as much property as the barrels of flour in

the hold. At this the stupid blockheads showed

their <i>ivory</i>, rolled up their white eyes in horror, as

if the idea of putting men on a footing with merchandise

were revolting to their humanity. When

these instructions were understood among the

negroes, it was impossible for us to keep them on

board. They deliberately gathered up their baggage

before our eyes, and, against our remonstrances,

poured through the gangway,&mdash;formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>

themselves into a procession on the wharf,&mdash;bid

farewell to all on board, and, uttering the wildest

shouts of exultation, they marched, amidst the

deafening cheers of a multitude of sympathizing

spectators, under the triumphant leadership of

their heroic chief and deliverer, <span class="smcap">Madison Washington</span>.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A PLEA FOR FREE SPEECH.</h2></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="autographs_images/line.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p class="center">Give me leave to speak my mind.<br />

<br />

<span class="gapleft2"><i>As You Like It.</i></span></p>





<p><span class="smcap">The</span> clamorous demand which certain patriotic

gentlemen are just now making for perfect silence

on the slavery question, strikes a quiet looker-on as

something very odd. It might pass for a dull sort

of joke, were it not that the means taken to enforce

it, by vexatious prosecutions, political and social

proscriptions, and newspaper assaults on private

reputation, are beginning, in certain quarters, to

assume a decidedly tragic aspect, and forcing upon

all anti-slavery men the alternative of peremptorily

refusing compliance, or standing meanly by to see

others crushed for advocating <i>their</i> opinions.</p>



<p>The question has been extensively, and I think

very naturally raised, why these anti-agitation gentlemen

do not keep silent themselves. For, strange

as it may seem, this perilous topic is the very one

which most of all appears to occupy their thoughts

too, and is ever uppermost when they undertake to

speak of the affairs of the country. They are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>

the predicament of the poor man in the Eastern

fable, who, being forbidden on pain of the genie&#8217;s

wrath to utter a certain cabalistic syllable, found,

to his horror, that he could never after open his

lips without their beginning perversely to frame the

tabooed articulation. But not, as in his case, does

fear chain up their organs. They speak it boldly

out, proclaim it &#8220;the corner-stone&#8221; of their political

creed, and do their best in every way, by

speeches and articles, Union-safety pamphlets and

National Convention platforms, to &#8220;keep it before

the people.&#8221; And the object always is, to keep

the people quiet! Surely, if the Union is <i>not</i>

strong enough to bear agitations, the special friends

of the Union have chosen a singular way to save it.</p>



<p>I would by no means infer, that they are <i>altogether</i>

insecure in their professions of anxiety.

The truth appears to be, however, that in so far as

these professions are not a sheer pretence, got up

by political men for political effect, our estimable

fellow citizens have, all unwittingly, been obeying

a higher law than that which they would impose

on their neighbors,&mdash;a law, written in the very

nature of the free soul. On this, the subject of the

age, they must think, and cannot refrain from

uttering their thoughts. &#8220;They believe, and <i>therefore</i>

have they spoken.&#8221; And it is a sufficient

reply to their unanswerable demand for silence on

the other side. &#8220;We <i>also</i> believe, and therefore

speak.&#8221; Pray, why not?</p>



<p>A certain ardent conservative friend of mine, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>

whom I once proposed this inquiry, made a short

answer to it after this fashion:&mdash;&#8220;The abolitionists

are all fools and fanatics. Whenever the idea

of anti-slavery gets hold of a man, he takes leave

of his common sense, and is thenceforth as one

possessed. I would put a padlock on every such

crazy fellow&#8217;s mouth.&#8221; My friend&#8217;s rule, it will be

seen, is a very broad one; stopping the mouths of

all who speak foolishly. Who will undertake to

see it fairly applied? or who could feel quite free

from nervousness in view of its possible operation?

Under an infallible administration, I apprehend,

many&mdash;some, perhaps, even of the most strenuous

advocates of the law&mdash;might find themselves

uncomfortably implicated, who at present hardly

suspect the danger. &#8220;By&#8217;rlakin, a parlous fear! my

masters, you ought to consider with yourselves!&#8221; I

am constrained to confess, that in the very midst

of my friend&#8217;s aforesaid patriotic diatribe against

folly and fanaticism, and his plea for a summary

fool-act, I could not keep out of my mind some

wicked recollections of Horace&#8217;s lines:</p>



<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">



<div class="verse"><i>Communi sensu plane caret</i>, inquimus. Eheu!</div>

<div class="verse">Quam temere in <i>nosmet</i> legem sancimus iniquam!</div>

</div></div>



<p>It must in all candor be confessed, that there is

something in the subject of slavery which, when

fairly looked at and realized, is a little trying to

one&#8217;s sanity. Even such intellects as John Wesley&#8217;s

and Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s, seem to stagger a

little under a view of the appalling sum of iniquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>

and wretchedness which the word represents, and

vent their excitement in terms not particularly

measured. What wonder, then, if men of simpler

minds should now and then be thrown quite off

the balance, and think and say some things that

are really unwise. I think, indeed, it will have to

be confessed, that we have had fools and fanatics

on both sides of the slavery question; and it is

altogether among the probabilities, that such will

continue to be the case hereafter. Still, until we

have some infallible criterion to distinguish actual

folly from that which foolish people merely think

such, I fancy we must forego the convenience of

my friend&#8217;s summary process, and, giving leave to

every man to speak his mind, leave it to Time&mdash;great

sifter of men and opinions&mdash;to separate

between the precious and the vile.</p>



<p>It may be the kindness bred of a fellow feeling,

but I must confess to a warm side towards my

brethren of the motley tribe. While on the one

hand I firmly hold with Elihu&mdash;who seems to

have represented young Uz among the friends of

Job&mdash;that &#8220;great men are not always wise.&#8221; I

rejoice on the other hand in the concession of

Polonius,&mdash;chief old Fogy of the court of Denmark,&mdash;that

there is &#8220;a happiness which madness

often hits on, that reason and sanity could not so

prosperously be delivered of.&#8221; Folly and craziness,

quotha! Did it, then, never occur to you, O Worldly

Wiseman, that even your wisdom might be bettered

by a dash of that which you thus contemptuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>

brand? Or does the apostle seem to you

as one that driveleth, when he says, &#8220;If any man

among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let

him become a fool, that he may be wise?&#8221;</p>



<p>I have often admired the sagacity of our mediaeval

forefathers, in the treatment of their (so called)

fools. They gave them a <i>special license</i> of the

tongue; for they justly estimated the advantages

which the truly wise know how to draw from the

untrammelled utterances of any honest mind,

especially of minds which, refusing to run tamely

in the oiled grooves of prescriptive and fashionable

orthodoxy, are the more likely, now and then,

(were it only by accident,) to hit upon truths of

which others miss. Hence they maintained an

&#8220;Independent Order&#8221; of the motley, whose only

business it was freely to think and freely speak

their minds. &#8220;I must have liberty withal,&#8221; says

Jaques, aspiring to this dignity.</p>



<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">



<div class="indent">&mdash;&#8220;as free a charter as the wind,</div>

<div class="verse">To blow on whom I please: for <i>so fools have</i>.&#8221;</div>

</div></div>



<p>And he adds, in a strain of admonition which

certain contemporaneous events might almost lead

one to consider prophetic,</p>



<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent">&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;they that are most galled with my folly,</div>

<div class="verse">They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</div>

<div class="verse">The <i>why</i> is plain as way to parish church.</div>

<div class="verse">He that a fool doth very wisely hit,</div>

<div class="verse">Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</div>

<div class="indent">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; What then? Let me see wherein</div>

<div class="verse">My speech hath wronged him. If it do him right,</div>

<div class="verse">Then he hath wronged himself; if he be free,</div>

<div class="verse">Why then, my taxing like a wild goose flies,</div>

<div class="verse">Unclaimed of any man.&#8221;</div>

</div></div></div>



<p>Now if there be &#8220;fools of the nineteenth century,&#8221;

as I devoutly hope there be,&mdash;men possessed

with the belief of a Higher Law, Inalienable Rights,

Supremacy of Conscience, and such like obsolete

phantoms, and passing strange judgments on the

deeds of men and nations in the light thereof,&mdash;I

beg to put in a similar plea for them. <i>Give

them leave to speak their minds.</i> Now and then, it

may be worth the pondering, and, heeded betimes,

may peradventure save from calamity and ruin.

If not, an attempt to <i>enforce</i> silence on fools&mdash;and

is it not much the same with freemen?&mdash;is

likely to produce, not silence at all, but a greater

outcry. And as for our great men and wise men,

when hit, let them conceal the smart, and profit by

the lesson. But, for their own greatness&#8217; sake, and

the honor of their wisdom, whither hit or not, let

them never fall into a passion at the freedom of

men&#8217;s speech, and cry, <i>This must be put down</i>. For

it will not down at their bidding.</p>



<p>But the subject refuses to be treated lightly.

The vast interests at stake on both sides, and the

immediate urgency of the crisis, compel the mind

to sobriety and solicitude in the contemplation of

it. No truly wise man will look upon the anti-slavery

doctrine as mere folly, or on the promulgation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>

of it as idle breath. It is the measureless

power of that sentiment&mdash;and all its power lies

in its truth&mdash;that wakens this alarm; and it is

the consciousness of holding such a weapon in

their hands, that makes the anti-slavery masses at

the North pause, lest in attempting to use it for

good, they should, unwittingly, do harm. For such

a sentiment, who can fail to feel respect? Who

would not despise himself if his own bosom were

destitute of it? But, by as much as I respect it

in others, and would cherish it in myself, by so

much will I resent all playing upon it by political

men for party or personal ends, and fear lest it betray

me into pusillanimity and inertness where the

times demand action for humanity and God. It

<i>is</i> a serious question for all honest anti-slavery

men throughout the land, in what way they can

most wisely and hopefully quit them of their responsibility

in relation to this thing. Their action

as citizens should, unquestionably, be restricted

by the just limits of their civil responsibility; as

men by those of their moral responsibility. Even

within those limits, they should act with a wise

moderation, and in a generous spirit of candor and

kindness. But one thing is abundantly certain,

that by ignoring the responsibility, they do not get

rid of it; by turning their backs on the obligation,

they will not get it discharged. Still the terrible

<i>fact</i> remains. <i>Still, the tears and blood of the enslaved

are daily dropping on our country&#8217;s soil.</i>

Throw over it what veil of extenuation and excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>

you may, the essential crime and shame remains.

Believe as kindly as you can of the treatment

which the slaves receive of humane and christian

masters; it is only on condition that they first surrender

their every <i>right</i> as men. Let them dare

demur to that, and their tears and blood must answer

it. That is the terrible fact; and <i>our country</i>

is the abettor, the protector, and the agent of

the iniquity. Must we be indifferent? <i>May</i> we

be indifferent? It is a question of tremendous

import to every freeman in the land, who honestly

believes that the rights he claims as a man are

common to the race.</p>



<p>We used to be told, and are sometimes still,

that this is a matter which belongs to our Southern

brethren exclusively, and that when we of the free

States interfere with it, we meddle with that which

is &#8220;none of our business.&#8221; And there was a time,

when this might be urged with a show of consistency.

It was when slavery claimed only to be

a creature of State legislation, and asked only of

the national government and the free States to be

let alone. Even then, it had no right of exemption

from the rational scrutiny to which all human

institutions are amenable, nor from the rebuke and

denouncement which all men may, in Heaven&#8217;s

name, utter against all iniquity done in the face of

Heaven. But the <i>special</i> right of republican citizens

to demand the correction of wrongs done by

<i>their own</i> government, attached in the matter of

slavery only to the citizens of the slave States.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>But a wonderful change has been passing before

our eyes. The attitude of slavery is entirely

altered. It now claims to be nationalized. It

demands a distinct recognition and active protection

from the general government, and indirect, but

most effectual support from every State in the

Union, and from every citizen thereof! The government

has acknowledged the validity of the

claim; and our great political leaders&mdash;some on

whom we have been wont to rely as stalwart

champions of freedom&mdash;have turned short round

in their tracks, and require us to believe that we

are <i>under constitutional obligations</i> to help maintain

the accursed thing,&mdash;yea, through all future time,

to do its most menial work! Nor is the doctrine

to be left in the dubious region of speculation. It

is already &#8220;a fixed fact,&#8221; terribly embodied in a

penal law. It enters the home of every Northern

freeman, and announces in thunder-tones this

ancestral obligation, which had so strangely faded

from the recollections of men. It tolerates no

dulness of apprehension, no hesitancy of belief.

It bids us all, on pain of imprisonments and fines,

to conquer our prejudices, to swallow our scruples,

to be still with our nonsensical humanities, and,

&#8220;as good citizens,&#8221; to start out at the whistle of a

United States&#8217; constable, to chase down miserable

negroes fleeing from the hell of bondage!</p>



<p>Slavery, then, has become <i>our</i> business at last;

and, as such, does it not behoove us to attend to

it? I think, in the language of honest Dogberry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>

that &#8220;that is proved already, and will go near to

be thought so shortly.&#8221; The thing lies in a nutshell.

Millard Fillmore is not our master, but our

servant. It is not his to prescribe duties, but ours;

and his, to perform them. What he does, in his

own person and by his subordinate executive

officers, he does for us, and on our responsibility.

What he does or they do, in other words, we do;

and we must abide the reckoning. In this responsibility,

the humblest citizen bears his share, and

cannot shirk it if he would. When, then, I see the

ministers of my country&#8217;s law consigning men

with flesh and blood like my own, with homes and

business, with wives and children,</p>



<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">As dear to them, as are the ruddy drops</div>

<div class="verse">That visit their sad hearts,</div>

</div></div>



<p>men unaccused of crime, and eating the daily bread

of honest labor&mdash;consigning them, I say, and their

posterity to hopeless vassalage, and degrading

chattelhood, by a process, too, which tramples

under foot the most ancient and sacred guarantees

of my own and my neighbors&#8217; rights. When I see

this great nation lay its terrible grasp upon the

throat of a feeble, unoffending man, and thrust

him back to worse than a felon&#8217;s fate for doing

that which no casuistry can torture into a crime, I

am compelled to feel that <i>it is myself</i> engaged in

this atrocious business; and no one but myself

can rid me of the responsibility. I can no longer

be silent; I dare no longer be silent; I will no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>

longer be silent. I will remonstrate and cry,

shame! I will refuse to obey the law; I will demand

to be released, and to have my country

released, from its odious requirements. I will

vote, and influence voters, and use every prerogative

of freedom, to throw at least from off my conscience

a burden that it cannot bear. And who

that is worthy to be free himself, will blame me?

To speak is no longer a mere right; it has become

a religious duty.</p>



<p>Let no man tell me, that this law is a mere

dead letter. The old Fugitive Law had, indeed,

become so; and so would any other be likely to

become, which, while grasping after the slave,

should pay a decent respect to the rights of the

free. But slavery cannot subsist on any such condition;

and this law was framed to supply the

deficiencies of the old law, and <i>to accomplish the

thing</i>. It is based on the assumption that the

government of the United States is bound to effect

the rendition of fugitives, if possible at all, <i>at whatever

cost</i>. And, if this law is insufficient, the

assumption is equally good for still more stringent

measures. But I repeat it, let no man tell me it

is <i>now</i> a nullity. Have we not seen it executed

in our streets, and at our very doors? I chanced

to be in the city of New York at the time when, I

think, its first victim, Henry Long, was torn from

his family, and from a reputable and profitable

business, and sent back,&mdash;limbs, and brain, and

throbbing, loving heart,&mdash;the husband, father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>

friend, the peaceful and industrious member of

society,&mdash;all, to be the <i>property</i> of a fellow-mortal

in a hostile land. Could I look upon this crimeless

man, thus in the grasp of the officers of my country&#8217;s

laws, my own representatives, and hurried

unresisting to that dreadful doom; and ever be

able to believe the law innocuous, and myself

guiltless while I acquiesced in silence? The rabble

followed him along the streets, shouting in exultation

at the negro&#8217;s fate. <i>Them</i> I must acknowledge

as my fellows and brethren, but <i>him</i>&mdash;on him I

must put my heel, with theirs, to crush him out

of manhood! And the morrow&#8217;s papers, edited

by professed Christians, heralded the occurrence,

with not even a decent pretence of pity and

regret, but as a triumph of <small>LAW</small>, (O sacred name

profaned!) in which all good men should rejoice.

That day I felt a stiffing sensation settling down

upon me, of which my previous experience had

afforded no precedent, and with an oppressive

weight which no language can describe. <i>I felt that

I no longer breathed the air of liberty</i>; that slavery

was spreading her Upas branches athwart <i>my</i> sky

also. The convenient apology that the sin was not

mine, but another&#8217;s, no longer stood me in stead;

and I have wondered ever since to hear any honest

Northern man employ it. There are Northern

men, from whom nothing could surprise me.</p>



<p>And what have we since witnessed? The inferior

officers of the law prowling throughout the

North for victims on whom to enforce it. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

superiors, even to the highest, laboring by speeches

and proclamations and journeyings to and fro in

the land (is it too much to say?) to <i>dragoon</i> the

people into its support. The national treasury

thrown wide open to meet its &#8220;extraordinary

expenses.&#8221; Fanueil Hall hung in chains, to ensure

its execution. Presidential candidates vieing with

each other in expressions of attachment and fidelity

to it. Able men, in church and State, spotted for

proscription for no other sin than hating that law,

and daring to declare that hatred. And to crown

the whole, the wisdom of the nation, in Baltimore

Conventions once and again assembled, pronouncing

the new doctrines of constitutional

responsibility, with the law that embodies it, not

only a certainty, but (hear it, O heavens!) a <i>finality</i>!

A new word in the political vocabulary, and

verily a new thing in the earth! &#8220;Finality,&#8221; in

the legislation of freemen! A finality, that forever

precludes reconsideration, amendment, or

repeal! When such things are said, and gravely

said, by men professing to be American statesmen,

I can almost imagine the fathers of my country

turning painfully in their graves. And can it be

possible, that in the same breath with which men

assume to roll political responsibilities on freemen,

they dare require perpetual silence and unconsidering

submission thereto? Then, what is it to be

free?</p>



<p>But let no one dream that these formidable

pronouncements have any enduring force. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>

natural, that Southern statesmen should seek, by

every possible expedient, to keep out the flood of

discussion from a system which can so illy bear it.

And it is not strange, that Northern politicians

should, for temporary purposes, assist them in the

effort. This is for a day; but the great tide of

human thought flows on forever, and there is no

spot from which it will be shut out. I remember

when the right of petition was denied by our

Southern brethren, in respect to this subject; and

they found compliant tools enough from the North

to work with for a season. But was the right of

petition sacrificed? Of course not. And is the

right of free discussion, the right to make and (if

we please) unmake our laws, less precious? This

subject <i>will</i> be agitated. This law will be reconsidered;

and, if it is not repealed, it will be for

the same reasons that ensures the continuance of

other laws, namely, because it is able to sustain

severe and ever recurring scrutiny.</p>



<p>But what is to become of the Union meanwhile?

One thing is very certain. If it deliberately

place itself in competition with those &#8220;blessings

of liberty,&#8221; which it was created to &#8220;secure,&#8221;

it <i>ought</i> to fall. Shall the end be sacrificed to

preserve the means, to which the end alone gives

value? And what are we to think of the statesmanship

of those, who, to effect that preservation,

would force such an issue on a people nursed at

the breasts of freedom? I would rather die than

live a traitor to my country; but let me die <i>ten

thousand</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> deaths before I prove treacherous to freedom

and to God. &#8220;If this be treason, make the

most of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>But it is worse than idle to talk so. There is no

such issue before the nation. We are not compelled

to choose between disunion and slavery;

a slavery, too, that would not only hold the black

man in its remorseless gripe, but put its fetters on

the conscience of the white man, and its gag into

his mouth. Our Southern brethren themselves,

even to save their cherished institution, would not

dare, would not desire to press such an alternative.

Were it so, who would not be ready to surrender

the Union as valueless to him, and to part company

with Southrons as men unworthy to be free?

But it is not so. There are Hotspurs, doubtless,

enough of them at the South; and Jehus, too

many, at the North. And there are cunning politicians

to stand between the two sections, and play

upon the prejudices of both, and into each other&#8217;s

hands, for selfish ends. But the great heart of the

nation, North and South, on the whole and according

to the measure of its understanding, beats true

alike to freedom and the constitution,&mdash;true to

that immortal sentiment which, as long as this

nation endures, shall encircle its author&#8217;s name

with a halo, in whose splendor some later words

that have fallen from his lips will be happily lost

and forgotten: &#8220;Liberty <i>and</i> Union, now and forever,

one and inseparable.&#8221; Whatever differences

there may be as to the nature, conditions, and obligations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>

of freedom, or as to the intent and meaning

of the constitution, no party among the people

will refuse to submit them to the ordeal of discussion,

and the arbitrament of the appointed tribunals.</p>



<p>While this is so, let him be deemed the traitor,

who stands up before the world, and belies his

country by declaring it to be otherwise. And let

every man prepare to enter into those discussions

which no human power can now stave off, in a

spirit of intelligent candor and kindness, but, at the

same time, of inflexible fidelity to God and man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> true wealth and glory of a nation consist

not in its gold dust, nor in its commerce, nor in the

grandeur of its palaces, nor yet in the magnificence

of its cities,&mdash;but in the intellectual and moral

energy of its people. Egypt is more glorious

because of her carrying into Greece the blessings

of civilization, than because of her pyramids,

however wondrous, her lakes and labyrinths, however

stupendous, or her Thebes, though every

square marked a palace, or every alley a dome.

Who hears of the moneyed men of Athens, of

Rome? And who does <i>not</i> hear of Socrates, of

Plato, of Demosthenes, of Virgil, of Cicero? Are

you in converse with him of the &#8220;Sea-girt Isle,&#8221;

and would touch the chord that vibrates most

readily in his heart?&mdash;then talk to him of Shakspeare,

of Milton, of Cowper, of Bacon, of Newton;

of Burns, of Scott. To the intelligent son

of the &#8220;Emerald Isle,&#8221; talk of Curran, of Emmett,

of O&#8217;Connell.</p>



<p>Great men are a nation&#8217;s vitality. Nations pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>

away,&mdash;great men, never. Great men are not unfrequently

buried in dungeons or in obscurity;

but they work out great thoughts for all time, nevertheless.

Did not Bunyan work out a great

thought all-vital and vitalizing, when he lay

twelve years in Bedford jail, weaving his tagged

lace, and writing his Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress? The

greatest man in all America is now in obscurity.

It is he who is &#8220;<i>the Lord of his own soul</i>,&#8221; on

whose brow wisdom has marked her supremacy,

and who, in his sphere, moves</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;Stilly as a star, on his eternal way.&#8221;</p>



<p>A great writer hath said, &#8220;Nature is stingy of

her great men.&#8221; I do not believe it. God doeth

all his work fitly and well; how, therefore, could

he give us great men, not plentifully, but stingily?

The truth is, there are great men, and they are

plentiful,&mdash;plentiful for the times, I mean,&mdash;but

we do not see them, because we will not come

into the sun-light of truth and rectitude where,

and where only, dwelleth greatness.</p>



<p>Placido was a great man. He was a great poet

besides. He was a patriot, also,&mdash;how could he

be otherwise? Are not all poets patriots?</p>



<p>&#8220;Adios Mundo,&#8221; cried he, as with tear-bedimmed

eyes he looked up into the blue heavens

above him, and upon the green earth beneath him;

and upon the portals of the universe read wisdom,

majesty, and power. Was there no poetry

in this outburst of a full heart, and in this looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>

upward to heaven? &#8220;Adios Mundo,&#8221; cried he,

as now beholding, for the last time, the home of

his love,&mdash;he bared his bosom to the death-shot

of the soldiers.</p>



<p>Great was Placido in life,&mdash;he was greater

still in death. His was the faith which fastens

itself upon the <small>EVERLASTING I AM</small>.</p>



<p>Call you that greatness which Pizarro achieved

when, seizing a sword and drawing a line upon

the sand from east to west, he himself facing

south, he said to his band of pirates:&mdash;&#8220;<i>Friends,

comrades, on that side are toil, hunger, nakedness,

the drenching storm, desertion, and death; on this

side, ease and pleasure. There lies Peru with its

richness; here Panama with its poverty. Choose,

each man what best becomes a brave Castillian.

For my part I go to the south</i>;&#8221;&mdash;suiting the action

to the word? So do I,&mdash;but look ye, this is

merely the greatness of overwhelming energy and

concentrated purpose, not illuminated by a single

ray of light from the Divine. See here, how Placido

dwarfeth Pizarro when he thus prayeth,</p>

<p>Placido had a symmetrically developed character.

All great men have this. His intellectual

and moral nature blended harmoniously as</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;Kindred elements into one.&#8221;</p>



<p>An ancient philosopher hath said that the passions

and the soul are placed in the same body, so that

the passions might have ready opportunity to persuade

the soul to become subservient to their purpose.

A terrible conflict. And yet through it

Placido passed triumphantly.</p>



<p>Placido was born a slave on the island of Cuba,

on the plantation of Don Terribio De Castro. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>

year of his birth I am unable to give, but it must

have been somewhere between the years 1790 and

1800. He was of African origin. But little is

known of his earliest days save that he was of

gentle demeanor, and wore an aspect which, though

mild, indicated the working of great thoughts

within. He was allowed some little advantage of

education in his youth, and he evinced great

poetic genius. The prayer just quoted was composed

by him while he lay in prison, and repeated

on his way from his dungeon to his place of

execution.</p>



<p>The Heraldo, a leading journal of Havana, thus

spoke of him after his arrest:&mdash;</p>



<p>&#8220;Placido is a celebrated poet,&mdash;a man of great

genius, but too wild and ambitious. His object

was to subdue Cuba, and make himself the chief.&#8221;</p>



<p>The following lines, also, were found inscribed

upon the walls of his dungeon. They were written

on the day previous to his execution.</p>



<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">



<div class="indent">&#8220;O Liberty! I wait for thee,</div>

<div class="indent3">To break this chain, and dungeon bar;</div>

<div class="indent">I hear thy voice calling me,</div>

<div class="indent3">Deep in the frozen North, afar,</div>

<div class="verse">With voice like God&#8217;s, and vision like a star.</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent">Long cradled in the mountain wind,</div>

<div class="indent3">Thy mates, the eagle and the storm:</div>

<div class="indent">Arise; and from thy brow unbind</div>

<div class="indent3">The wreath that gives its starry form,</div>

<div class="verse">And smite the strength, that would thy strength deform.</div>

</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent">Yet Liberty! thy dawning light,</div>

<div class="indent3">Obscured by dungeon bars, shall cast</div>

<div class="indent">A splendor on the breaking night,</div>

<div class="indent3">And tyrants, flying thick and fast,</div>

<div class="verse">Shall tremble at thy gaze, and stand aghast.&#8221;</div>

</div></div></div>



<p>In poetic feeling, patriotic spirit, living faith,

and, withal in literary beauty, these lines are not

surpassed; and they cannot fail to rank Placido

not only with the great-hearted, but with the gifted

men of the earth. A tribute to his genius is

recorded in the fact, that he was ransomed from

slavery by the contributions of slave-holders of

Cuba.</p>



<p>Placido was executed on the 7th of July, 1844.

On the first fire of the soldiers, no ball entered his

heart. He looked up, but with no spirit of

revenge, no aspect of defiance,&mdash;only sat upon his

countenance the desire to pass at once into the

region where no death is.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pity me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and fire here,&#8221;&mdash;putting

his hand upon his heart. Two balls then entered

his body, and Placido fell.</p>



<p>As Wordsworth said of Toussaint, so may it be

said of Placido,&mdash;</p>



<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">



<div class="indent5">&#8220;Thou hast left behind thee</div>

<div class="verse">That will forget thee; thou hast great allies,</div>

<div class="verse">Thy friends are exultations, agonies,</div>

<div class="verse">And love, and man&#8217;s unconquerable mind.&#8221;</div>

</div></div>











<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>The charge against Placido was, that he was

at the head of a conspiracy to overthrow slavery in

his native island. Blessings on thee, Placido!

Nor didst thou fail of thy mission. Did the

martyrs, stake-bound, fail of theirs? As the Lord

liveth, Cuba shall yet be free.</p>



<p>That Placido was at the head of this conspiracy

there is not a doubt; but what his plans in detail

were, I know not; the means of acquiring them are

not within my reach. Nevertheless, from the treatment

throughout of the Cuban authorities towards

Placido, we may safely conclude that Placido&#8217;s plan

in detail evinced no lack of ability to originate and

execute, nor of that sagacity which should mark a

revolutionary leader. Placido hated slavery with a

hatred intensified by the remembrance of wrongs

which a loving and loved mother had borne. The

iron, too, had entered into his own soul; and he

had been a daily witness of scenes such as torment

itself could scarcely equal, nor the pit itself

outdo. Call you this extravagance? You will

not,&mdash;should you but study a single chapter in

the history of Cuban slavery.</p>



<p>Do you honor Kossuth?&mdash;then forget not him

who is worthy to stand side by side with Hungary&#8217;s

illustrious son.</p>



<p>What may be the destiny of Cuba in the future

near at hand, I will not venture to predict. What

may be her <i>ultimate</i> destiny is written in the fact

that,&mdash;&#8220;God hath no attribute which, in a contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>

between the oppressed and the oppressor, can

take sides with the latter.&#8221;</p>



<p>This sketch, though hastily written, and meagre

in detail as it must necessarily be, will show, at

least, by the quotations of poetry introduced, that

God hath not given to one race alone, all intellectual

and moral greatness.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_S_19" id="Footnote_S_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_S_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> Congress, the legislative department, and, of course, the

judicial, its interpreter, were intended to be founded on such

undoubted principles of liberty, that it would be difficult for

them to use their everywhere acknowledged rights, and perform

their everywhere expected duties, without first putting

aside the strongest impediment to their exercise, slavery. In

our judgment this has been done. There is no truth in public

law more certain than that protection and allegiance are reciprocal.

They must exist together or not at all. The power of

the United States is adequate for the protection of all within

her limits, and from all within them she expects allegiance. If

she is informed in any way to be relied on, that any person is restrained

of his rights under the constitution of the United

States, it is her duty to see him set at liberty, if he be confined,

and see that he is redressed. It is in vain for Congress to excuse

itself from acting, by saying that it is a <i>State</i> concern.

Can a citizen of the <i>United States</i>, if he be a citizen, be tortured

or tormented by a <i>State</i>, when there is no pretence that

he has violated the law of either?

</p>

<p>

The constitution of the United States authorizes no man to

hold another as a slave. The United States has no power to

hold a slave. It matters not that it was <i>intended</i> to allow some

to hold others as their slaves. A very vile person may <i>intend</i>

to lock up in prison an innocent and just one, but through

mistake he leaves the door unlocked; does this, in the eyes of

any reasonable men, prevent his making his escape through the

door? We are certain not. The only proper inquiry here is,

which is supreme, the government of the Union, or the government

of a particular State of it. It is not necessary to answer

this. If the first deal with no one as a slave, the subordinate

cannot by law. Persons may be held as slaves by fraud, by

cunning, by taking advantage of the ignorance in which we

hold them, by force, or a successful combination of force, but

not by <small>LAW</small>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_T_20" id="Footnote_T_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_T_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> &#8220;Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake bay,

whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter

of the habitable globe. Those beautiful vessels, robed in

purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to me so

many shrouded ghosts to terrify and torment me with thoughts

of my wretched condition. I have often, in the deep stillness

of a summer&#8217;s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty banks of

that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful

eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty

ocean. The sight of these always affected me powerfully. My

thoughts would compel utterance; and then, with no audience

but the Almighty, I would pour out my soul&#8217;s complaint, in my

rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of

ships:&mdash;

</p>

<p>

&#8220;You are loosed from your moorings, and are free; I am

fast in my chains, and am a slave! You move merrily before

the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloody whip! You are

freedom&#8217;s swift-winged angels that fly around the world; I am

confined in bands of iron! O that I were free! O that I were

on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing!

Alas! betwixt me and you the turbid waters roll. Go on, go

on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could

fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute!

The glad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left

in the hottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save me! God,

deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Why am

I a slave? I will run away. * * * Only think of it; one

hundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try it? Yes!

God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die

a slave. * * *&#8221;&mdash;<i>Autobiography of Douglass</i>, pp. 64, 65.</p></div>

It was pressed upon me by every object within sight

or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silver trump of freedom

had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness. Freedom now

appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every

sound, and seen in everything. It was ever present to torment

me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing

without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt

nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star; it smiled

in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every

storm.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Autobiography</i>, pp. 40, 41.</p></div>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United

States without permission and without paying copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

1.F.



1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

cannot be read by your equipment.



1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

DAMAGE.



1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing

without further opportunities to fix the problem.



1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.



1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

remaining provisions.



1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any

Defect you cause.



Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm



Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

from people in all walks of life.



Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation



The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.



The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation



Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

status with the IRS.



The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate



While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

approach us with offers to donate.



International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.



Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate



Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.



Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project

Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be

freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and

distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

volunteer support.



Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed

editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in

the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

edition.



Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search

facility: www.gutenberg.org



This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
